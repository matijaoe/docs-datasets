    "html": "ESCAPE HATCHES\nReusing Logic with Custom Hooks\n\nReact comes with several built-in Hooks like useState, useContext, and useEffect. Sometimes, you’ll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. You might not find these Hooks in React, but you can create your own Hooks for your application’s needs.\n\nYou will learn\nWhat custom Hooks are, and how to write your own\nHow to reuse logic between components\nHow to name and structure your custom Hooks\nWhen and why to extract custom Hooks\nCustom Hooks: Sharing logic between components \n\nImagine you’re developing an app that heavily relies on the network (as most apps do). You want to warn the user if their network connection has accidentally gone off while they were using your app. How would you go about it? It seems like you’ll need two things in your component:\n\nA piece of state that tracks whether the network is online.\nAn Effect that subscribes to the global online and offline events, and updates that state.\n\nThis will keep your component synchronized with the network status. You might start with something like this:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function StatusBar() {\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function handleOnline() {\n      setIsOnline(true);\n    }\n    function handleOffline() {\n      setIsOnline(false);\n    }\n    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTry turning your network on and off, and notice how this StatusBar updates in response to your actions.\n\nNow imagine you also want to use the same logic in a different component. You want to implement a Save button that will become disabled and show “Reconnecting…” instead of “Save” while the network is off.\n\nTo start, you can copy and paste the isOnline state and the Effect into SaveButton:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function SaveButton() {\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function handleOnline() {\n      setIsOnline(true);\n    }\n    function handleOffline() {\n      setIsOnline(false);\n    }\n    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nVerify that, if you turn off the network, the button will change its appearance.\n\nThese two components work fine, but the duplication in logic between them is unfortunate. It seems like even though they have different visual appearance, you want to reuse the logic between them.\n\nExtracting your own custom Hook from a component \n\nImagine for a moment that, similar to useState and useEffect, there was a built-in useOnlineStatus Hook. Then both of these components could be simplified and you could remove the duplication between them:\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlthough there is no such built-in Hook, you can write it yourself. Declare a function called useOnlineStatus and move all the duplicated code into it from the components you wrote earlier:\n\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    function handleOnline() {\n\n      setIsOnline(true);\n\n    }\n\n    function handleOffline() {\n\n      setIsOnline(false);\n\n    }\n\n    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n\n    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n\n    return () => {\n\n      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n\n      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\nAt the end of the function, return isOnline. This lets your components read that value:\n\nApp.js\nuseOnlineStatus.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SaveButton />\n      <StatusBar />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nVerify that switching the network on and off updates both components.\n\nNow your components don’t have as much repetitive logic. More importantly, the code inside them describes what they want to do (use the online status!) rather than how to do it (by subscribing to the browser events).\n\nWhen you extract logic into custom Hooks, you can hide the gnarly details of how you deal with some external system or a browser API. The code of your components expresses your intent, not the implementation.\n\nHook names always start with use \n\nReact applications are built from components. Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom. You’ll likely often use custom Hooks created by others, but occasionally you might write one yourself!\n\nYou must follow these naming conventions:\n\nReact component names must start with a capital letter, like StatusBar and SaveButton. React components also need to return something that React knows how to display, like a piece of JSX.\nHook names must start with use followed by a capital letter, like useState (built-in) or useOnlineStatus (custom, like earlier on the page). Hooks may return arbitrary values.\n\nThis convention guarantees that you can always look at a component and know where its state, Effects, and other React features might “hide”. For example, if you see a getColor() function call inside your component, you can be sure that it can’t possibly contain React state inside because its name doesn’t start with use. However, a function call like useOnlineStatus() will most likely contain calls to other Hooks inside!\n\nNote\n\nIf your linter is configured for React, it will enforce this naming convention. Scroll up to the sandbox above and rename useOnlineStatus to getOnlineStatus. Notice that the linter won’t allow you to call useState or useEffect inside of it anymore. Only Hooks and components can call other Hooks!\n\nDEEP DIVE\nShould all functions called during rendering start with the use prefix? \nShow Details\nCustom Hooks let you share stateful logic, not state itself \n\nIn the earlier example, when you turned the network on and off, both components updated together. However, it’s wrong to think that a single isOnline state variable is shared between them. Look at this code:\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIt works the same way as before you extracted the duplication:\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, []);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, []);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThese are two completely independent state variables and Effects! They happened to have the same value at the same time because you synchronized them with the same external value (whether the network is on).\n\nTo better illustrate this, we’ll need a different example. Consider this Form component:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Mary');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Poppins');\n\n  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  function handleLastNameChange(e) {\n    setLastName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />\n      </label>\n      <p><b>Good morning, {firstName} {lastName}.</b></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThere’s some repetitive logic for each form field:\n\nThere’s a piece of state (firstName and lastName).\nThere’s a change handler (handleFirstNameChange and handleLastNameChange).\nThere’s a piece of JSX that specifies the value and onChange attributes for that input.\n\nYou can extract the repetitive logic into this useFormInput custom Hook:\n\nApp.js\nuseFormInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport function useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  function handleChange(e) {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  const inputProps = {\n    value: value,\n    onChange: handleChange\n  };\n\n  return inputProps;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that it only declares one state variable called value.\n\nHowever, the Form component calls useFormInput two times:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is why it works like declaring two separate state variables!\n\nCustom Hooks let you share stateful logic but not state itself. Each call to a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook. This is why the two sandboxes above are completely equivalent. If you’d like, scroll back up and compare them. The behavior before and after extracting a custom Hook is identical.\n\nWhen you need to share the state itself between multiple components, lift it up and pass it down instead.\n\nPassing reactive values between Hooks \n\nThe code inside your custom Hooks will re-run during every re-render of your component. This is why, like components, custom Hooks need to be pure. Think of custom Hooks’ code as part of your component’s body!\n\nBecause custom Hooks re-render together with your component, they always receive the latest props and state. To see what this means, consider this chat room example. Change the server URL or the chat room:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nnotifications.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\nimport { showNotification } from './notifications.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const options = {\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n      roomId: roomId\n    };\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.on('message', (msg) => {\n      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n    });\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:\n        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you change serverUrl or roomId, the Effect “reacts” to your changes and re-synchronizes. You can tell by the console messages that the chat re-connects every time that you change your Effect’s dependencies.\n\nNow move the Effect’s code into a custom Hook:\n\nexport function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (msg) => {\n\n      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n}\n\nThis lets your ChatRoom component call your custom Hook without worrying about how it works inside:\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useChatRoom({\n\n    roomId: roomId,\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Server URL:\n\n        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis looks much simpler! (But it does the same thing.)\n\nNotice that the logic still responds to prop and state changes. Try editing the server URL or the selected room:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nuseChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nnotifications.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:\n        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how you’re taking the return value of one Hook:\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useChatRoom({\n\n    roomId: roomId,\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\nand pass it as an input to another Hook:\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useChatRoom({\n\n    roomId: roomId,\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\nEvery time your ChatRoom component re-renders, it passes the latest roomId and serverUrl to your Hook. This is why your Effect re-connects to the chat whenever their values are different after a re-render. (If you ever worked with audio or video processing software, chaining Hooks like this might remind you of chaining visual or audio effects. It’s as if the output of useState “feeds into” the input of the useChatRoom.)\n\nPassing event handlers to custom Hooks \nUnder Construction\n\nThis section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.\n\nAs you start using useChatRoom in more components, you might want to let components customize its behavior. For example, currently, the logic for what to do when a message arrives is hardcoded inside the Hook:\n\nexport function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (msg) => {\n\n      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n}\n\nLet’s say you want to move this logic back to your component:\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useChatRoom({\n\n    roomId: roomId,\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n    onReceiveMessage(msg) {\n\n      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\nTo make this work, change your custom Hook to take onReceiveMessage as one of its named options:\n\nexport function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (msg) => {\n\n      onReceiveMessage(msg);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl, onReceiveMessage]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n}\n\nThis will work, but there’s one more improvement you can do when your custom Hook accepts event handlers.\n\nAdding a dependency on onReceiveMessage is not ideal because it will cause the chat to re-connect every time the component re-renders. Wrap this event handler into an Effect Event to remove it from the dependencies:\n\nimport { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';\n\n// ...\n\n\n\nexport function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {\n\n  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(onReceiveMessage);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (msg) => {\n\n      onMessage(msg);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n}\n\nNow the chat won’t re-connect every time that the ChatRoom component re-renders. Here is a fully working demo of passing an event handler to a custom Hook that you can play with:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nuseChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nnotifications.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';\nimport { showNotification } from './notifications.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n    onReceiveMessage(msg) {\n      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n    }\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:\n        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how you no longer need to know how useChatRoom works in order to use it. You could add it to any other component, pass any other options, and it would work the same way. That’s the power of custom Hooks.\n\nWhen to use custom Hooks \n\nYou don’t need to extract a custom Hook for every little duplicated bit of code. Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a useFormInput Hook to wrap a single useState call like earlier is probably unnecessary.\n\nHowever, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer to also wrap it in a custom Hook. You shouldn’t need Effects very often, so if you’re writing one, it means that you need to “step outside React” to synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn’t have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely communicate your intent and how the data flows through it.\n\nFor example, consider a ShippingForm component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this:\n\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n\n  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);\n\n  // This Effect fetches cities for a country\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)\n\n      .then(response => response.json())\n\n      .then(json => {\n\n        if (!ignore) {\n\n          setCities(json);\n\n        }\n\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [country]);\n\n\n\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n\n  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);\n\n  // This Effect fetches areas for the selected city\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (city) {\n\n      let ignore = false;\n\n      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)\n\n        .then(response => response.json())\n\n        .then(json => {\n\n          if (!ignore) {\n\n            setAreas(json);\n\n          }\n\n        });\n\n      return () => {\n\n        ignore = true;\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n  }, [city]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nAlthough this code is quite repetitive, it’s correct to keep these Effects separate from each other. They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn’t merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the ShippingForm component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own useData Hook:\n\nfunction useData(url) {\n\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (url) {\n\n      let ignore = false;\n\n      fetch(url)\n\n        .then(response => response.json())\n\n        .then(json => {\n\n          if (!ignore) {\n\n            setData(json);\n\n          }\n\n        });\n\n      return () => {\n\n        ignore = true;\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n\n}\n\nNow you can replace both Effects in the ShippingForm components with calls to useData:\n\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n\n  // ...\n\nExtracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the url in and you get the data out. By “hiding” your Effect inside useData, you also prevent someone working on the ShippingForm component from adding unnecessary dependencies to it. With time, most of your app’s Effects will be in custom Hooks.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nKeep your custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases \nShow Details\nCustom Hooks help you migrate to better patterns \n\nEffects are an “escape hatch”: you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. With time, the React team’s goal is to reduce the number of the Effects in your app to the minimum by providing more specific solutions to more specific problems. Wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.\n\nLet’s return to this example:\n\nApp.js\nuseOnlineStatus.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function handleOnline() {\n      setIsOnline(true);\n    }\n    function handleOffline() {\n      setIsOnline(false);\n    }\n    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);\n      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);\n    };\n  }, []);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn the above example, useOnlineStatus is implemented with a pair of useState and useEffect. However, this isn’t the best possible solution. There is a number of edge cases it doesn’t consider. For example, it assumes that when the component mounts, isOnline is already true, but this may be wrong if the network already went offline. You can use the browser navigator.onLine API to check for that, but using it directly would not work on the server for generating the initial HTML. In short, this code could be improved.\n\nLuckily, React 18 includes a dedicated API called useSyncExternalStore which takes care of all of these problems for you. Here is how your useOnlineStatus Hook, rewritten to take advantage of this new API:\n\nApp.js\nuseOnlineStatus.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n  return useSyncExternalStore(\n    subscribe,\n    () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client\n    () => true // How to get the value on the server\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how you didn’t need to change any of the components to make this migration:\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis is another reason for why wrapping Effects in custom Hooks is often beneficial:\n\nYou make the data flow to and from your Effects very explicit.\nYou let your components focus on the intent rather than on the exact implementation of your Effects.\nWhen React adds new features, you can remove those Effects without changing any of your components.\n\nSimilar to a design system, you might find it helpful to start extracting common idioms from your app’s components into custom Hooks. This will keep your components’ code focused on the intent, and let you avoid writing raw Effects very often. Many excellent custom Hooks are maintained by the React community.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWill React provide any built-in solution for data fetching? \nShow Details\nThere is more than one way to do it \n\nLet’s say you want to implement a fade-in animation from scratch using the browser requestAnimationFrame API. You might start with an Effect that sets up an animation loop. During each frame of the animation, you could change the opacity of the DOM node you hold in a ref until it reaches 1. Your code might start like this:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\n\nfunction Welcome() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const duration = 1000;\n    const node = ref.current;\n\n    let startTime = performance.now();\n    let frameId = null;\n\n    function onFrame(now) {\n      const timePassed = now - startTime;\n      const progress = Math.min(timePassed / duration, 1);\n      onProgress(progress);\n      if (progress < 1) {\n        // We still have more frames to paint\n        frameId = requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);\n      }\n    }\n\n    function onProgress(progress) {\n      node.style.opacity = progress;\n    }\n\n    function start() {\n      onProgress(0);\n      startTime = performance.now();\n      frameId = requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);\n    }\n\n    function stop() {\n      cancelAnimationFrame(frameId);\n      startTime = null;\n      frameId = null;\n    }\n\n    start();\n    return () => stop();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <h1 className=\"welcome\" ref={ref}>\n      Welcome\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}\n      </button>\n      <hr />\n      {show && <Welcome />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo make the component more readable, you might extract the logic into a useFadeIn custom Hook:\n\nApp.js\nuseFadeIn.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\nimport { useFadeIn } from './useFadeIn.js';\n\nfunction Welcome() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useFadeIn(ref, 1000);\n\n  return (\n    <h1 className=\"welcome\" ref={ref}>\n      Welcome\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}\n      </button>\n      <hr />\n      {show && <Welcome />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou could keep the useFadeIn code as is, but you could also refactor it more. For example, you could extract the logic for setting up the animation loop out of useFadeIn into a custom useAnimationLoop Hook:\n\nApp.js\nuseFadeIn.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { experimental_useEffectEvent as useEffectEvent } from 'react';\n\nexport function useFadeIn(ref, duration) {\n  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(true);\n\n  useAnimationLoop(isRunning, (timePassed) => {\n    const progress = Math.min(timePassed / duration, 1);\n    ref.current.style.opacity = progress;\n    if (progress === 1) {\n      setIsRunning(false);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nfunction useAnimationLoop(isRunning, drawFrame) {\n  const onFrame = useEffectEvent(drawFrame);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!isRunning) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    const startTime = performance.now();\n    let frameId = null;\n\n    function tick(now) {\n      const timePassed = now - startTime;\n      onFrame(timePassed);\n      frameId = requestAnimationFrame(tick);\n    }\n\n    tick();\n    return () => cancelAnimationFrame(frameId);\n  }, [isRunning]);\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHowever, you didn’t have to do that. As with regular functions, ultimately you decide where to draw the boundaries between different parts of your code. You could also take a very different approach. Instead of keeping the logic in the Effect, you could move most of the imperative logic inside a JavaScript class:\n\nApp.js\nuseFadeIn.js\nanimation.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { FadeInAnimation } from './animation.js';\n\nexport function useFadeIn(ref, duration) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const animation = new FadeInAnimation(ref.current);\n    animation.start(duration);\n    return () => {\n      animation.stop();\n    };\n  }, [ref, duration]);\n}\n\n\n\nEffects let you connect React to external systems. The more coordination between Effects is needed (for example, to chain multiple animations), the more it makes sense to extract that logic out of Effects and Hooks completely like in the sandbox above. Then, the code you extracted becomes the “external system”. This lets your Effects stay simple because they only need to send messages to the system you’ve moved outside React.\n\nThe examples above assume that the fade-in logic needs to be written in JavaScript. However, this particular fade-in animation is both simpler and much more efficient to implement with a plain CSS Animation:\n\nApp.js\nwelcome.css\nReset\nFork\n.welcome {\n  color: white;\n  padding: 50px;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-size: 50px;\n  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(63,94,251,1) 0%, rgba(252,70,107,1) 100%);\n\n  animation: fadeIn 1000ms;\n}\n\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n  0% { opacity: 0; }\n  100% { opacity: 1; }\n}\n\n\n\nSometimes, you don’t even need a Hook!\n\nRecap\nCustom Hooks let you share logic between components.\nCustom Hooks must be named starting with use followed by a capital letter.\nCustom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.\nYou can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay up-to-date.\nAll Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.\nThe code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your component’s code.\nWrap event handlers received by custom Hooks into Effect Events.\nDon’t create custom Hooks like useMount. Keep their purpose specific.\nIt’s up to you how and where to choose the boundaries of your code.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Extract a useCounter Hook\n2. Make the counter delay configurable\n3. Extract useInterval out of useCounter\n4. Fix a resetting interval\n5. Implement a staggering movement\nChallenge 1 of 5: Extract a useCounter Hook \n\nThis component uses a state variable and an Effect to display a number that increments every second. Extract this logic into a custom Hook called useCounter. Your goal is to make the Counter component implementation look exactly like this:\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n\n  const count = useCounter();\n\n  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;\n\n}\n\nYou’ll need to write your custom Hook in useCounter.js and import it into the Counter.js file.\n\nApp.js\nuseCounter.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\n      setCount(c => c + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n    return () => clearInterval(id);\n  }, []);\n  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;\n}\n\n\nShow solution\nNext Challenge\nPREVIOUS\nRemoving Effect Dependencies"

    "html": "ESCAPE HATCHES\nRemoving Effect Dependencies\n\nWhen you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you’ve included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect’s dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. Follow this guide to review and remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to fix infinite Effect dependency loops\nWhat to do when you want to remove a dependency\nHow to read a value from your Effect without “reacting” to it\nHow and why to avoid object and function dependencies\nWhy suppressing the dependency linter is dangerous, and what to do instead\nDependencies should match the code \n\nWhen you write an Effect, you first specify how to start and stop whatever you want your Effect to be doing:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  \t// ...\n\n}\n\nThen, if you leave the Effect dependencies empty ([]), the linter will suggest the correct dependencies:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, []); // <-- Fix the mistake here!\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nFill them in according to what the linter says:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nEffects “react” to reactive values. Since roomId is a reactive value (it can change due to a re-render), the linter verifies that you’ve specified it as a dependency. If roomId receives a different value, React will re-synchronize your Effect. This ensures that the chat stays connected to the selected room and “reacts” to the dropdown:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nTo remove a dependency, prove that it’s not a dependency \n\nNotice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared in your dependency list. The dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads that reactive value\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify that reactive value as a dependency of your Effect\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReactive values include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since roomId is a reactive value, you can’t remove it from the dependency list. The linter wouldn’t allow it:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'roomId'\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nAnd the linter would be right! Since roomId may change over time, this would introduce a bug in your code.\n\nTo remove a dependency, “prove” to the linter that it doesn’t need to be a dependency. For example, you can move roomId out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nconst roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow that roomId is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\nconst roomId = 'music';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, []);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nThis is why you could now specify an empty ([]) dependency list. Your Effect really doesn’t depend on any reactive value anymore, so it really doesn’t need to re-run when any of the component’s props or state change.\n\nTo change the dependencies, change the code \n\nYou might have noticed a pattern in your workflow:\n\nFirst, you change the code of your Effect or how your reactive values are declared.\nThen, you follow the linter and adjust the dependencies to match the code you have changed.\nIf you’re not happy with the list of dependencies, you go back to the first step (and change the code again).\n\nThe last part is important. If you want to change the dependencies, change the surrounding code first. You can think of the dependency list as a list of all the reactive values used by your Effect’s code. You don’t choose what to put on that list. The list describes your code. To change the dependency list, change the code.\n\nThis might feel like solving an equation. You might start with a goal (for example, to remove a dependency), and you need to “find” the code matching that goal. Not everyone finds solving equations fun, and the same thing could be said about writing Effects! Luckily, there is a list of common recipes that you can try below.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:\n\n  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n\n}, []);\n\nWhen dependencies don’t match the code, there is a very high risk of introducing bugs. By suppressing the linter, you “lie” to React about the values your Effect depends on.\n\nInstead, use the techniques below.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy is suppressing the dependency linter so dangerous? \nShow Details\nRemoving unnecessary dependencies \n\nEvery time you adjust the Effect’s dependencies to reflect the code, look at the dependency list. Does it make sense for the Effect to re-run when any of these dependencies change? Sometimes, the answer is “no”:\n\nYou might want to re-execute different parts of your Effect under different conditions.\nYou might want to only read the latest value of some dependency instead of “reacting” to its changes.\nA dependency may change too often unintentionally because it’s an object or a function.\n\nTo find the right solution, you’ll need to answer a few questions about your Effect. Let’s walk through them.\n\nShould this code move to an event handler? \n\nThe first thing you should think about is whether this code should be an Effect at all.\n\nImagine a form. On submit, you set the submitted state variable to true. You need to send a POST request and show a notification. You’ve put this logic inside an Effect that “reacts” to submitted being true:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (submitted) {\n\n      // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect\n\n      post('/api/register');\n\n      showNotification('Successfully registered!');\n\n    }\n\n  }, [submitted]);\n\n\n\n  function handleSubmit() {\n\n    setSubmitted(true);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nLater, you want to style the notification message according to the current theme, so you read the current theme. Since theme is declared in the component body, it is a reactive value, so you add it as a dependency:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (submitted) {\n\n      // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect\n\n      post('/api/register');\n\n      showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);\n\n    }\n\n  }, [submitted, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n\n\n  function handleSubmit() {\n\n    setSubmitted(true);\n\n  }  \n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nBy doing this, you’ve introduced a bug. Imagine you submit the form first and then switch between Dark and Light themes. The theme will change, the Effect will re-run, and so it will display the same notification again!\n\nThe problem here is that this shouldn’t be an Effect in the first place. You want to send this POST request and show the notification in response to submitting the form, which is a particular interaction. To run some code in response to particular interaction, put that logic directly into the corresponding event handler:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n\n\n  function handleSubmit() {\n\n    // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers\n\n    post('/api/register');\n\n    showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);\n\n  }  \n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow that the code is in an event handler, it’s not reactive—so it will only run when the user submits the form. Read more about choosing between event handlers and Effects and how to delete unnecessary Effects.\n\nIs your Effect doing several unrelated things? \n\nThe next question you should ask yourself is whether your Effect is doing several unrelated things.\n\nImagine you’re creating a shipping form where the user needs to choose their city and area. You fetch the list of cities from the server according to the selected country to show them in a dropdown:\n\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n\n  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);\n\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)\n\n      .then(response => response.json())\n\n      .then(json => {\n\n        if (!ignore) {\n\n          setCities(json);\n\n        }\n\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [country]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is a good example of fetching data in an Effect. You are synchronizing the cities state with the network according to the country prop. You can’t do this in an event handler because you need to fetch as soon as ShippingForm is displayed and whenever the country changes (no matter which interaction causes it).\n\nNow let’s say you’re adding a second select box for city areas, which should fetch the areas for the currently selected city. You might start by adding a second fetch call for the list of areas inside the same Effect:\n\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n\n  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);\n\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n\n  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)\n\n      .then(response => response.json())\n\n      .then(json => {\n\n        if (!ignore) {\n\n          setCities(json);\n\n        }\n\n      });\n\n    // 🔴 Avoid: A single Effect synchronizes two independent processes\n\n    if (city) {\n\n      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)\n\n        .then(response => response.json())\n\n        .then(json => {\n\n          if (!ignore) {\n\n            setAreas(json);\n\n          }\n\n        });\n\n    }\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [country, city]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nHowever, since the Effect now uses the city state variable, you’ve had to add city to the list of dependencies. That, in turn, introduced a problem: when the user selects a different city, the Effect will re-run and call fetchCities(country). As a result, you will be unnecessarily refetching the list of cities many times.\n\nThe problem with this code is that you’re synchronizing two different unrelated things:\n\nYou want to synchronize the cities state to the network based on the country prop.\nYou want to synchronize the areas state to the network based on the city state.\n\nSplit the logic into two Effects, each of which reacts to the prop that it needs to synchronize with:\n\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n\n  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)\n\n      .then(response => response.json())\n\n      .then(json => {\n\n        if (!ignore) {\n\n          setCities(json);\n\n        }\n\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [country]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n\n\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n\n  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (city) {\n\n      let ignore = false;\n\n      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)\n\n        .then(response => response.json())\n\n        .then(json => {\n\n          if (!ignore) {\n\n            setAreas(json);\n\n          }\n\n        });\n\n      return () => {\n\n        ignore = true;\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n  }, [city]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nNow the first Effect only re-runs if the country changes, while the second Effect re-runs when the city changes. You’ve separated them by purpose: two different things are synchronized by two separate Effects. Two separate Effects have two separate dependency lists, so they won’t trigger each other unintentionally.\n\nThe final code is longer than the original, but splitting these Effects is still correct. Each Effect should represent an independent synchronization process. In this example, deleting one Effect doesn’t break the other Effect’s logic. This means they synchronize different things, and it’s good to split them up. If you’re concerned about duplication, you can improve this code by extracting repetitive logic into a custom Hook.\n\nAre you reading some state to calculate the next state? \n\nThis Effect updates the messages state variable with a newly created array every time a new message arrives:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);\n\n    });\n\n    // ...\n\nIt uses the messages variable to create a new array starting with all the existing messages and adds the new message at the end. However, since messages is a reactive value read by an Effect, it must be a dependency:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, messages]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nAnd making messages a dependency introduces a problem.\n\nEvery time you receive a message, setMessages() causes the component to re-render with a new messages array that includes the received message. However, since this Effect now depends on messages, this will also re-synchronize the Effect. So every new message will make the chat re-connect. The user would not like that!\n\nTo fix the issue, don’t read messages inside the Effect. Instead, pass an updater function to setMessages:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice how your Effect does not read the messages variable at all now. You only need to pass an updater function like msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]. React puts your updater function in a queue and will provide the msgs argument to it during the next render. This is why the Effect itself doesn’t need to depend on messages anymore. As a result of this fix, receiving a chat message will no longer make the chat re-connect.\n\nDo you want to read a value without “reacting” to its changes? \nUnder Construction\n\nThis section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.\n\nSuppose that you want to play a sound when the user receives a new message unless isMuted is true:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);\n\n      if (!isMuted) {\n\n        playSound();\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    // ...\n\nSince your Effect now uses isMuted in its code, you have to add it to the dependencies:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);\n\n      if (!isMuted) {\n\n        playSound();\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, isMuted]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nThe problem is that every time isMuted changes (for example, when the user presses the “Muted” toggle), the Effect will re-synchronize, and reconnect to the chat. This is not the desired user experience! (In this example, even disabling the linter would not work—if you do that, isMuted would get “stuck” with its old value.)\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to extract the logic that shouldn’t be reactive out of the Effect. You don’t want this Effect to “react” to the changes in isMuted. Move this non-reactive piece of logic into an Effect Event:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(receivedMessage => {\n\n    setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);\n\n    if (!isMuted) {\n\n      playSound();\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      onMessage(receivedMessage);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nEffect Events let you split an Effect into reactive parts (which should “react” to reactive values like roomId and their changes) and non-reactive parts (which only read their latest values, like onMessage reads isMuted). Now that you read isMuted inside an Effect Event, it doesn’t need to be a dependency of your Effect. As a result, the chat won’t re-connect when you toggle the “Muted” setting on and off, solving the original issue!\n\nWrapping an event handler from the props \n\nYou might run into a similar problem when your component receives an event handler as a prop:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      onReceiveMessage(receivedMessage);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, onReceiveMessage]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nSuppose that the parent component passes a different onReceiveMessage function on every render:\n\n<ChatRoom\n\n  roomId={roomId}\n\n  onReceiveMessage={receivedMessage => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }}\n\n/>\n\nSince onReceiveMessage is a dependency, it would cause the Effect to re-synchronize after every parent re-render. This would make it re-connect to the chat. To solve this, wrap the call in an Effect Event:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {\n\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(receivedMessage => {\n\n    onReceiveMessage(receivedMessage);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {\n\n      onMessage(receivedMessage);\n\n    });\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nEffect Events aren’t reactive, so you don’t need to specify them as dependencies. As a result, the chat will no longer re-connect even if the parent component passes a function that’s different on every re-render.\n\nSeparating reactive and non-reactive code \n\nIn this example, you want to log a visit every time roomId changes. You want to include the current notificationCount with every log, but you don’t want a change to notificationCount to trigger a log event.\n\nThe solution is again to split out the non-reactive code into an Effect Event:\n\nfunction Chat({ roomId, notificationCount }) {\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedRoomId => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedRoomId, notificationCount);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onVisit(roomId);\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou want your logic to be reactive with regards to roomId, so you read roomId inside of your Effect. However, you don’t want a change to notificationCount to log an extra visit, so you read notificationCount inside of the Effect Event. Learn more about reading the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events.\n\nDoes some reactive value change unintentionally? \n\nSometimes, you do want your Effect to “react” to a certain value, but that value changes more often than you’d like—and might not reflect any actual change from the user’s perspective. For example, let’s say that you create an options object in the body of your component, and then read that object from inside of your Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  const options = {\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n    roomId: roomId\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nThis object is declared in the component body, so it’s a reactive value. When you read a reactive value like this inside an Effect, you declare it as a dependency. This ensures your Effect “reacts” to its changes:\n\n  // ...\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nIt is important to declare it as a dependency! This ensures, for example, that if the roomId changes, your Effect will re-connect to the chat with the new options. However, there is also a problem with the code above. To see it, try typing into the input in the sandbox below, and watch what happens in the console:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  // Temporarily disable the linter to demonstrate the problem\n  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n  const options = {\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n    roomId: roomId\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [options]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn the sandbox above, the input only updates the message state variable. From the user’s perspective, this should not affect the chat connection. However, every time you update the message, your component re-renders. When your component re-renders, the code inside of it runs again from scratch.\n\nA new options object is created from scratch on every re-render of the ChatRoom component. React sees that the options object is a different object from the options object created during the last render. This is why it re-synchronizes your Effect (which depends on options), and the chat re-connects as you type.\n\nThis problem only affects objects and functions. In JavaScript, each newly created object and function is considered distinct from all the others. It doesn’t matter that the contents inside of them may be the same!\n\n// During the first render\n\nconst options1 = { serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234', roomId: 'music' };\n\n\n\n// During the next render\n\nconst options2 = { serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234', roomId: 'music' };\n\n\n\n// These are two different objects!\n\nconsole.log(Object.is(options1, options2)); // false\n\nObject and function dependencies can make your Effect re-synchronize more often than you need.\n\nThis is why, whenever possible, you should try to avoid objects and functions as your Effect’s dependencies. Instead, try moving them outside the component, inside the Effect, or extracting primitive values out of them.\n\nMove static objects and functions outside your component \n\nIf the object does not depend on any props and state, you can move that object outside your component:\n\nconst options = {\n\n  serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n  roomId: 'music'\n\n};\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nThis way, you prove to the linter that it’s not reactive. It can’t change as a result of a re-render, so it doesn’t need to be a dependency. Now re-rendering ChatRoom won’t cause your Effect to re-synchronize.\n\nThis works for functions too:\n\nfunction createOptions() {\n\n  return {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n    roomId: 'music'\n\n  };\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nSince createOptions is declared outside your component, it’s not a reactive value. This is why it doesn’t need to be specified in your Effect’s dependencies, and why it won’t ever cause your Effect to re-synchronize.\n\nMove dynamic objects and functions inside your Effect \n\nIf your object depends on some reactive value that may change as a result of a re-render, like a roomId prop, you can’t pull it outside your component. You can, however, move its creation inside of your Effect’s code:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nNow that options is declared inside of your Effect, it is no longer a dependency of your Effect. Instead, the only reactive value used by your Effect is roomId. Since roomId is not an object or function, you can be sure that it won’t be unintentionally different. In JavaScript, numbers and strings are compared by their content:\n\n// During the first render\n\nconst roomId1 = 'music';\n\n\n\n// During the next render\n\nconst roomId2 = 'music';\n\n\n\n// These two strings are the same!\n\nconsole.log(Object.is(roomId1, roomId2)); // true\n\nThanks to this fix, the chat no longer re-connects if you edit the input:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const options = {\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n      roomId: roomId\n    };\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHowever, it does re-connect when you change the roomId dropdown, as you would expect.\n\nThis works for functions, too:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    function createOptions() {\n\n      return {\n\n        serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n        roomId: roomId\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nYou can write your own functions to group pieces of logic inside your Effect. As long as you also declare them inside your Effect, they’re not reactive values, and so they don’t need to be dependencies of your Effect.\n\nRead primitive values from objects \n\nSometimes, you may receive an object from props:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ options }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nThe risk here is that the parent component will create the object during rendering:\n\n<ChatRoom\n\n  roomId={roomId}\n\n  options={{\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n    roomId: roomId\n\n  }}\n\n/>\n\nThis would cause your Effect to re-connect every time the parent component re-renders. To fix this, read information from the object outside the Effect, and avoid having object and function dependencies:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ options }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const { roomId, serverUrl } = options;\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection({\n\n      roomId: roomId,\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n    });\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nThe logic gets a little repetitive (you read some values from an object outside an Effect, and then create an object with the same values inside the Effect). But it makes it very explicit what information your Effect actually depends on. If an object is re-created unintentionally by the parent component, the chat would not re-connect. However, if options.roomId or options.serverUrl really are different, the chat would re-connect.\n\nCalculate primitive values from functions \n\nThe same approach can work for functions. For example, suppose the parent component passes a function:\n\n<ChatRoom\n\n  roomId={roomId}\n\n  getOptions={() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }}\n\n/>\n\nTo avoid making it a dependency (and causing it to re-connect on re-renders), call it outside the Effect. This gives you the roomId and serverUrl values that aren’t objects, and that you can read from inside your Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ getOptions }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const { roomId, serverUrl } = getOptions();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection({\n\n      roomId: roomId,\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n    });\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nThis only works for pure functions because they are safe to call during rendering. If your function is an event handler, but you don’t want its changes to re-synchronize your Effect, wrap it into an Effect Event instead.\n\nRecap\nDependencies should always match the code.\nWhen you’re not happy with your dependencies, what you need to edit is the code.\nSuppressing the linter leads to very confusing bugs, and you should always avoid it.\nTo remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it’s not necessary.\nIf some code should run in response to a specific interaction, move that code to an event handler.\nIf different parts of your Effect should re-run for different reasons, split it into several Effects.\nIf you want to update some state based on the previous state, pass an updater function.\nIf you want to read the latest value without “reacting” it, extract an Effect Event from your Effect.\nIn JavaScript, objects and functions are considered different if they were created at different times.\nTry to avoid object and function dependencies.

    "html": "ESCAPE HATCHES\nSeparating Events from Effects\n\nEvent handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if some value they read, like a prop or a state variable, is different from what it was during the last render. Sometimes, you also want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others. This page will teach you how to do that.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to choose between an event handler and an Effect\nWhy Effects are reactive, and event handlers are not\nWhat to do when you want a part of your Effect’s code to not be reactive\nWhat Effect Events are, and how to extract them from your Effects\nHow to read the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events\nChoosing between event handlers and Effects \n\nFirst, let’s recap the difference between event handlers and Effects.\n\nImagine you’re implementing a chat room component. Your requirements look like this:\n\nYour component should automatically connect to the selected chat room.\nWhen you click the “Send” button, it should send a message to the chat.\n\nLet’s say you’ve already implemented the code for them, but you’re not sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every time you need to answer this question, consider why the code needs to run.\n\nEvent handlers run in response to specific interactions \n\nFrom the user’s perspective, sending a message should happen because the particular “Send” button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let you handle specific interactions:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  // ...\n\n  function handleSendClick() {\n\n    sendMessage(message);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>;\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWith an event handler, you can be sure that sendMessage(message) will only run if the user presses the button.\n\nEffects run whenever synchronization is needed \n\nRecall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat room. Where does that code go?\n\nThe reason to run this code is not some particular interaction. It doesn’t matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they’re looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not performed any interactions at all, you would still need to connect. This is why it’s an Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWith this code, you can be sure that there is always an active connection to the currently selected chat server, regardless of the specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another screen and back, your Effect ensures that the component will remain synchronized with the currently selected room, and will re-connect whenever it’s necessary.\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  function handleSendClick() {\n    sendMessage(message);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nReactive values and reactive logic \n\nIntuitively, you could say that event handlers are always triggered “manually”, for example by clicking a button. Effects, on the other hand, are “automatic”: they run and re-run as often as it’s needed to stay synchronized.\n\nThere is a more precise way to think about this.\n\nProps, state, and variables declared inside your component’s body are called reactive values. In this example, serverUrl is not a reactive value, but roomId and message are. They participate in the rendering data flow:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example, the user may edit the message or choose a different roomId in a dropdown. Event handlers and Effects respond to changes differently:\n\nLogic inside event handlers is not reactive. It will not run again unless the user performs the same interaction (e.g. a click) again. Event handlers can read reactive values without “reacting” to their changes.\nLogic inside Effects is reactive. If your Effect reads a reactive value, you have to specify it as a dependency. Then, if a re-render causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect’s logic with the new value.\n\nLet’s revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference.\n\nLogic inside event handlers is not reactive \n\nTake a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not?\n\n    // ...\n\n    sendMessage(message);\n\n    // ...\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, a change to the message does not mean that they want to send a message. It only means that the user is typing. In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive. It should not run again only because the reactive value has changed. That’s why it belongs in the event handler:\n\n  function handleSendClick() {\n\n    sendMessage(message);\n\n  }\n\nEvent handlers aren’t reactive, so sendMessage(message) will only run when the user clicks the Send button.\n\nLogic inside Effects is reactive \n\nNow let’s return to these lines:\n\n    // ...\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, a change to the roomId does mean that they want to connect to a different room. In other words, the logic for connecting to the room should be reactive. You want these lines of code to “keep up” with the reactive value, and to run again if that value is different. That’s why it belongs in an Effect:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect()\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\nEffects are reactive, so createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) and connection.connect() will run for every distinct value of roomId. Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently selected room.\n\nExtracting non-reactive logic out of Effects \n\nThings get more tricky when you want to mix reactive logic with non-reactive logic.\n\nFor example, imagine that you want to show a notification when the user connects to the chat. You read the current theme (dark or light) from the props so that you can show the notification in the correct color:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n\n      showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n\n    });\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nHowever, theme is a reactive value (it can change as a result of re-rendering), and every reactive value read by an Effect must be declared as its dependency. Now you have to specify theme as a dependency of your Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n\n      showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n\n    });\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect()\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nPlay with this example and see if you can spot the problem with this user experience:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nnotifications.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';\nimport { showNotification } from './notifications.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n      showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n    });\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId, theme]);\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={isDark}\n          onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}\n        />\n        Use dark theme\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom\n        roomId={roomId}\n        theme={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen the roomId changes, the chat re-connects as you would expect. But since theme is also a dependency, the chat also re-connects every time you switch between the dark and the light theme. That’s not great!\n\nIn other words, you don’t want this line to be reactive, even though it is inside an Effect (which is reactive):\n\n      // ...\n\n      showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n\n      // ...\n\nYou need a way to separate this non-reactive logic from the reactive Effect around it.\n\nDeclaring an Effect Event \nUnder Construction\n\nThis section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.\n\nUse a special Hook called useEffectEvent to extract this non-reactive logic out of your Effect:\n\nimport { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n\n  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {\n\n    showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\nHere, onConnected is called an Effect Event. It’s a part of your Effect logic, but it behaves a lot more like an event handler. The logic inside it is not reactive, and it always “sees” the latest values of your props and state.\n\nNow you can call the onConnected Effect Event from inside your Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n\n  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {\n\n    showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n\n      onConnected();\n\n    });\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\nThis solves the problem. Note that you had to remove onConnected from the list of your Effect’s dependencies. Effect Events are not reactive and must be omitted from dependencies.\n\nVerify that the new behavior works as you would expect:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { experimental_useEffectEvent as useEffectEvent } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';\nimport { showNotification } from './notifications.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {\n    showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n      onConnected();\n    });\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={isDark}\n          onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}\n        />\n        Use dark theme\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom\n        roomId={roomId}\n        theme={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can think of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers. The main difference is that event handlers run in response to a user interactions, whereas Effect Events are triggered by you from Effects. Effect Events let you “break the chain” between the reactivity of Effects and code that should not be reactive.\n\nReading latest props and state with Effect Events \nUnder Construction\n\nThis section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.\n\nEffect Events let you fix many patterns where you might be tempted to suppress the dependency linter.\n\nFor example, say you have an Effect to log the page visits:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit();\n\n  }, []);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nLater, you add multiple routes to your site. Now your Page component receives a url prop with the current path. You want to pass the url as a part of your logVisit call, but the dependency linter complains:\n\nfunction Page({ url }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(url);\n\n  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'url'\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThink about what you want the code to do. You want to log a separate visit for different URLs since each URL represents a different page. In other words, this logVisit call should be reactive with respect to the url. This is why, in this case, it makes sense to follow the dependency linter, and add url as a dependency:\n\nfunction Page({ url }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(url);\n\n  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow let’s say you want to include the number of items in the shopping cart together with every page visit:\n\nfunction Page({ url }) {\n\n  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);\n\n  const numberOfItems = items.length;\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(url, numberOfItems);\n\n  }, [url]); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'numberOfItems'\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou used numberOfItems inside the Effect, so the linter asks you to add it as a dependency. However, you don’t want the logVisit call to be reactive with respect to numberOfItems. If the user puts something into the shopping cart, and the numberOfItems changes, this does not mean that the user visited the page again. In other words, visiting the page is, in some sense, an “event”. It happens at a precise moment in time.\n\nSplit the code in two parts:\n\nfunction Page({ url }) {\n\n  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);\n\n  const numberOfItems = items.length;\n\n\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onVisit(url);\n\n  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nHere, onVisit is an Effect Event. The code inside it isn’t reactive. This is why you can use numberOfItems (or any other reactive value!) without worrying that it will cause the surrounding code to re-execute on changes.\n\nOn the other hand, the Effect itself remains reactive. Code inside the Effect uses the url prop, so the Effect will re-run after every re-render with a different url. This, in turn, will call the onVisit Effect Event.\n\nAs a result, you will call logVisit for every change to the url, and always read the latest numberOfItems. However, if numberOfItems changes on its own, this will not cause any of the code to re-run.\n\nNote\n\nYou might be wondering if you could call onVisit() with no arguments, and read the url inside it:\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(() => {\n\n    logVisit(url, numberOfItems);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onVisit();\n\n  }, [url]);\n\nThis would work, but it’s better to pass this url to the Effect Event explicitly. By passing url as an argument to your Effect Event, you are saying that visiting a page with a different url constitutes a separate “event” from the user’s perspective. The visitedUrl is a part of the “event” that happened:\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onVisit(url);\n\n  }, [url]);\n\nSince your Effect Event explicitly “asks” for the visitedUrl, now you can’t accidentally remove url from the Effect’s dependencies. If you remove the url dependency (causing distinct page visits to be counted as one), the linter will warn you about it. You want onVisit to be reactive with regards to the url, so instead of reading the url inside (where it wouldn’t be reactive), you pass it from your Effect.\n\nThis becomes especially important if there is some asynchronous logic inside the Effect:\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n\n      onVisit(url);\n\n    }, 5000); // Delay logging visits\n\n  }, [url]);\n\nHere, url inside onVisit corresponds to the latest url (which could have already changed), but visitedUrl corresponds to the url that originally caused this Effect (and this onVisit call) to run.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nIs it okay to suppress the dependency linter instead? \nShow Details\nLimitations of Effect Events \nUnder Construction\n\nThis section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.\n\nEffect Events are very limited in how you can use them:\n\nOnly call them from inside Effects.\nNever pass them to other components or Hooks.\n\nFor example, don’t declare and pass an Effect Event like this:\n\nfunction Timer() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {\n\n    setCount(count + 1);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useTimer(onTick, 1000); // 🔴 Avoid: Passing Effect Events\n\n\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction useTimer(callback, delay) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\n\n      callback();\n\n    }, delay);\n\n    return () => {\n\n      clearInterval(id);\n\n    };\n\n  }, [delay, callback]); // Need to specify \"callback\" in dependencies\n\n}\n\nInstead, always declare Effect Events directly next to the Effects that use them:\n\nfunction Timer() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useTimer(() => {\n\n    setCount(count + 1);\n\n  }, 1000);\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction useTimer(callback, delay) {\n\n  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {\n\n    callback();\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\n\n      onTick(); // ✅ Good: Only called locally inside an Effect\n\n    }, delay);\n\n    return () => {\n\n      clearInterval(id);\n\n    };\n\n  }, [delay]); // No need to specify \"onTick\" (an Effect Event) as a dependency\n\n}\n\nEffect Events are non-reactive “pieces” of your Effect code. They should be next to the Effect using them.\n\nRecap\nEvent handlers run in response to specific interactions.\nEffects run whenever synchronization is needed.\nLogic inside event handlers is not reactive.\nLogic inside Effects is reactive.\nYou can move non-reactive logic from Effects into Effect Events.\nOnly call Effect Events from inside Effects.\nDon’t pass Effect Events to other components or Hooks.\nTry out some challenges\n1.

You can control the increment variable with the plus and minus buttons.\n\nHowever, no matter how many times you click the plus button, the counter is still incremented by one every second.

    "html": "ESCAPE HATCHES\nLifecycle of Reactive Effects\n\nEffects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time. React provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly. This keeps your Effect synchronized to the latest props and state.\n\nYou will learn\nHow an Effect’s lifecycle is different from a component’s lifecycle\nHow to think about each individual Effect in isolation\nWhen your Effect needs to re-synchronize, and why\nHow your Effect’s dependencies are determined\nWhat it means for a value to be reactive\nWhat an empty dependency array means\nHow React verifies your dependencies are correct with a linter\nWhat to do when you disagree with the linter\nThe lifecycle of an Effect \n\nEvery React component goes through the same lifecycle:\n\nA component mounts when it’s added to the screen.\nA component updates when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.\nA component unmounts when it’s removed from the screen.\n\nIt’s a good way to think about components, but not about Effects. Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component’s lifecycle. An Effect describes how to synchronize an external system to the current props and state. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYour Effect’s body specifies how to start synchronizing:\n\n    // ...\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n    // ...\n\nThe cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to stop synchronizing:\n\n    // ...\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n    // ...\n\nIntuitively, you might think that React would start synchronizing when your component mounts and stop synchronizing when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to start and stop synchronizing multiple times while the component remains mounted.\n\nLet’s look at why this is necessary, when it happens, and how you can control this behavior.\n\nNote\n\nSome Effects don’t return a cleanup function at all. More often than not, you’ll want to return one—but if you don’t, React will behave as if you returned an empty cleanup function.\n\nWhy synchronization may need to happen more than once \n\nImagine this ChatRoom component receives a roomId prop that the user picks in a dropdown. Let’s say that initially the user picks the \"general\" room as the roomId. Your app displays the \"general\" chat room:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"general\" */ }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n\n}\n\nAfter the UI is displayed, React will run your Effect to start synchronizing. It connects to the \"general\" room:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"general\" */ }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the \"general\" room\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the \"general\" room\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nLater, the user picks a different room in the dropdown (for example, \"travel\"). First, React will update the UI:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"travel\" */ }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n\n}\n\nThink about what should happen next. The user sees that \"travel\" is the selected chat room in the UI. However, the Effect that ran the last time is still connected to the \"general\" room. The roomId prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the \"general\" room) no longer matches the UI.\n\nAt this point, you want React to do two things:\n\nStop synchronizing with the old roomId (disconnect from the \"general\" room)\nStart synchronizing with the new roomId (connect to the \"travel\" room)\n\nLuckily, you’ve already taught React how to do both of these things! Your Effect’s body specifies how to start synchronizing, and your cleanup function specifies how to stop synchronizing. All that React needs to do now is to call them in the correct order and with the correct props and state. Let’s see how exactly that happens.\n\nHow React re-synchronizes your Effect \n\nRecall that your ChatRoom component has received a new value for its roomId prop. It used to be \"general\", and now it is \"travel\". React needs to re-synchronize your Effect to re-connect you to a different room.\n\nTo stop synchronizing, React will call the cleanup function that your Effect returned after connecting to the \"general\" room. Since roomId was \"general\", the cleanup function disconnects from the \"general\" room:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"general\" */ }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the \"general\" room\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the \"general\" room\n\n    };\n\n    // ...\n\nThen React will run the Effect that you’ve provided during this render. This time, roomId is \"travel\" so it will start synchronizing to the \"travel\" chat room (until its cleanup function is eventually called too):\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"travel\" */ }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the \"travel\" room\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nThanks to this, you’re now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster averted!\n\nEvery time after your component re-renders with a different roomId, your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, let’s say the user changes roomId from \"travel\" to \"music\". React will again stop synchronizing your Effect by calling its cleanup function (disconnecting you from the \"travel\" room). Then it will start synchronizing again by running its body with the new roomId prop (connecting you to the \"music\" room).\n\nFinally, when the user goes to a different screen, ChatRoom unmounts. Now there is no need to stay connected at all. React will stop synchronizing your Effect one last time and disconnect you from the \"music\" chat room.\n\nThinking from the Effect’s perspective \n\nLet’s recap everything that’s happened from the ChatRoom component’s perspective:\n\nChatRoom mounted with roomId set to \"general\"\nChatRoom updated with roomId set to \"travel\"\nChatRoom updated with roomId set to \"music\"\nChatRoom unmounted\n\nDuring each of these points in the component’s lifecycle, your Effect did different things:\n\nYour Effect connected to the \"general\" room\nYour Effect disconnected from the \"general\" room and connected to the \"travel\" room\nYour Effect disconnected from the \"travel\" room and connected to the \"music\" room\nYour Effect disconnected from the \"music\" room\n\nNow let’s think about what happened from the perspective of the Effect itself:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // Your Effect connected to the room specified with roomId...\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      // ...until it disconnected\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\nThis code’s structure might inspire you to see what happened as a sequence of non-overlapping time periods:\n\nYour Effect connected to the \"general\" room (until it disconnected)\nYour Effect connected to the \"travel\" room (until it disconnected)\nYour Effect connected to the \"music\" room (until it disconnected)\n\nPreviously, you were thinking from the component’s perspective. When you looked from the component’s perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as “callbacks” or “lifecycle events” that fire at a specific time like “after a render” or “before unmount”. This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it’s best to avoid.\n\nInstead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it’s needed.\n\nThis might remind you how you don’t think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React figures out the rest.\n\nHow React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize \n\nHere is a live example that you can play with. Press “Open chat” to mount the ChatRoom component:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that when the component mounts for the first time, you see three logs:\n\n✅ Connecting to \"general\" room at https://localhost:1234... (development-only)\n❌ Disconnected from \"general\" room at https://localhost:1234. (development-only)\n✅ Connecting to \"general\" room at https://localhost:1234...\n\nThe first two logs are development-only. In development, React always remounts each component once.\n\nReact verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development. This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check you’ve implemented its cleanup well.\n\nThe main reason your Effect will re-synchronize in practice is if some data it uses has changed. In the sandbox above, change the selected chat room. Notice how, when the roomId changes, your Effect re-synchronizes.\n\nHowever, there are also more unusual cases in which re-synchronization is necessary. For example, try editing the serverUrl in the sandbox above while the chat is open. Notice how the Effect re-synchronizes in response to your edits to the code. In the future, React may add more features that rely on re-synchronization.\n\nHow React knows that it needs to re-synchronize the Effect \n\nYou might be wondering how React knew that your Effect needed to re-synchronize after roomId changes. It’s because you told React that its code depends on roomId by including it in the list of dependencies:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // The roomId prop may change over time\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads roomId \n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]); // So you tell React that this Effect \"depends on\" roomId\n\n  // ...\n\nHere’s how this works:\n\nYou knew roomId is a prop, which means it can change over time.\nYou knew that your Effect reads roomId (so its logic depends on a value that may change later).\nThis is why you specified it as your Effect’s dependency (so that it re-synchronizes when roomId changes).\n\nEvery time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize your Effect.\n\nFor example, if you passed [\"general\"] during the initial render, and later you passed [\"travel\"] during the next render, React will compare \"general\" and \"travel\". These are different values (compared with Object.is), so React will re-synchronize your Effect. On the other hand, if your component re-renders but roomId has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room.\n\nEach Effect represents a separate synchronization process \n\nResist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time as an Effect you already wrote. For example, let’s say you want to send an analytics event when the user visits the room. You already have an Effect that depends on roomId, so you might feel tempted to add the analytics call there:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(roomId);\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nBut imagine you later add another dependency to this Effect that needs to re-establish the connection. If this Effect re-synchronizes, it will also call logVisit(roomId) for the same room, which you did not intend. Logging the visit is a separate process from connecting. Write them as two separate Effects:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(roomId);\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nEach Effect in your code should represent a separate and independent synchronization process.\n\nIn the above example, deleting one Effect wouldn’t break the other Effect’s logic. This is a good indication that they synchronize different things, and so it made sense to split them up. On the other hand, if you split up a cohesive piece of logic into separate Effects, the code may look “cleaner” but will be more difficult to maintain. This is why you should think whether the processes are same or separate, not whether the code looks cleaner.\n\nEffects “react” to reactive values \n\nYour Effect reads two variables (serverUrl and roomId), but you only specified roomId as a dependency:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhy doesn’t serverUrl need to be a dependency?\n\nThis is because the serverUrl never changes due to a re-render. It’s always the same no matter how many times the component re-renders and why. Since serverUrl never changes, it wouldn’t make sense to specify it as a dependency. After all, dependencies only do something when they change over time!\n\nOn the other hand, roomId may be different on a re-render. Props, state, and other values declared inside the component are reactive because they’re calculated during rendering and participate in the React data flow.\n\nIf serverUrl was a state variable, it would be reactive. Reactive values must be included in dependencies:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // Props change over time\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // State may change over time\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads props and state\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So you tell React that this Effect \"depends on\" on props and state\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nBy including serverUrl as a dependency, you ensure that the Effect re-synchronizes after it changes.\n\nTry changing the selected chat room or edit the server URL in this sandbox:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhenever you change a reactive value like roomId or serverUrl, the Effect re-connects to the chat server.\n\nWhat an Effect with empty dependencies means \n\nWhat happens if you move both serverUrl and roomId outside the component?\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nconst roomId = 'general';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow your Effect’s code does not use any reactive values, so its dependencies can be empty ([]).\n\nThinking from the component’s perspective, the empty [] dependency array means this Effect connects to the chat room only when the component mounts, and disconnects only when the component unmounts. (Keep in mind that React would still re-synchronize it an extra time in development to stress-test your logic.)\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\nconst roomId = 'general';\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, []);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHowever, if you think from the Effect’s perspective, you don’t need to think about mounting and unmounting at all. What’s important is you’ve specified what your Effect does to start and stop synchronizing. Today, it has no reactive dependencies. But if you ever want the user to change roomId or serverUrl over time (and they would become reactive), your Effect’s code won’t change. You will only need to add them to the dependencies.\n\nAll variables declared in the component body are reactive \n\nProps and state aren’t the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.\n\nLet’s say that the user can pick a chat server in the dropdown, but they can also configure a default server in settings. Suppose you’ve already put the settings state in a context so you read the settings from that context. Now you calculate the serverUrl based on the selected server from props and the default server:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, selectedServerUrl }) { // roomId is reactive\n\n  const settings = useContext(SettingsContext); // settings is reactive\n\n  const serverUrl = selectedServerUrl ?? settings.defaultServerUrl; // serverUrl is reactive\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads roomId and serverUrl\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So it needs to re-synchronize when either of them changes!\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIn this example, serverUrl is not a prop or a state variable. It’s a regular variable that you calculate during rendering. But it’s calculated during rendering, so it can change due to a re-render. This is why it’s reactive.\n\nAll values inside the component (including props, state, and variables in your component’s body) are reactive. Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect’s dependencies.\n\nIn other words, Effects “react” to all values from the component body.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nCan global or mutable values be dependencies? \nShow Details\nReact verifies that you specified every reactive value as a dependency \n\nIf your linter is configured for React, it will check that every reactive value used by your Effect’s code is declared as its dependency. For example, this is a lint error because both roomId and serverUrl are reactive:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // roomId is reactive\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // serverUrl is reactive\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, []); // <-- Something's wrong here!\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis may look like a React error, but really React is pointing out a bug in your code. Both roomId and serverUrl may change over time, but you’re forgetting to re-synchronize your Effect when they change. You will remain connected to the initial roomId and serverUrl even after the user picks different values in the UI.\n\nTo fix the bug, follow the linter’s suggestion to specify roomId and serverUrl as dependencies of your Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // roomId is reactive\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // serverUrl is reactive\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTry this fix in the sandbox above. Verify that the linter error is gone, and the chat re-connects when needed.\n\nNote\n\nIn some cases, React knows that a value never changes even though it’s declared inside the component. For example, the set function returned from useState and the ref object returned by useRef are stable—they are guaranteed to not change on a re-render. Stable values aren’t reactive, so you may omit them from the list. Including them is allowed: they won’t change, so it doesn’t matter.\n\nWhat to do when you don’t want to re-synchronize \n\nIn the previous example, you’ve fixed the lint error by listing roomId and serverUrl as dependencies.\n\nHowever, you could instead “prove” to the linter that these values aren’t reactive values, i.e. that they can’t change as a result of a re-render. For example, if serverUrl and roomId don’t depend on rendering and always have the same values, you can move them outside the component. Now they don’t need to be dependencies:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive\n\nconst roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou can also move them inside the Effect. They aren’t calculated during rendering, so they’re not reactive:\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive\n\n    const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nEffects are reactive blocks of code. They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary.\n\nYou can’t “choose” your dependencies. Your dependencies must include every reactive value you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. Sometimes this may lead to problems like infinite loops and to your Effect re-synchronizing too often. Don’t fix these problems by suppressing the linter! Here’s what to try instead:\n\nCheck that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process. If your Effect doesn’t synchronize anything, it might be unnecessary. If it synchronizes several independent things, split it up.\n\nIf you want to read the latest value of props or state without “reacting” to it and re-synchronizing the Effect, you can split your Effect into a reactive part (which you’ll keep in the Effect) and a non-reactive part (which you’ll extract into something called an Effect Event). Read about separating Events from Effects.\n\nAvoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies. If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time. Read more about removing unnecessary dependencies from Effects.\n\nPitfall\n\nThe linter is your friend, but its powers are limited. The linter only knows when the dependencies are wrong. It doesn’t know the best way to solve each case. If the linter suggests a dependency, but adding it causes a loop, it doesn’t mean the linter should be ignored. You need to change the code inside (or outside) the Effect so that that value isn’t reactive and doesn’t need to be a dependency.\n\nIf you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:\n\n  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n\n}, []);\n\nOn the next pages, you’ll learn how to fix this code without breaking the rules. It’s always worth fixing!\n\nRecap\nComponents can mount, update, and unmount.\nEach Effect has a separate lifecycle from the surrounding component.\nEach Effect describes a separate synchronization process that can start and stop.\nWhen you write and read Effects, think from each individual Effect’s perspective (how to start and stop synchronization) rather than from the component’s perspective (how it mounts, updates, or unmounts).\nValues declared inside the component body are “reactive”.\nReactive values should re-synchronize the Effect because they can change over time.\nThe linter verifies that all reactive values used inside the Effect are specified as dependencies.\nAll errors flagged by the linter are legitimate. There’s always a way to fix the code to not break the rules.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Fix reconnecting on every keystroke\n2. Switch synchronization on and off\n3. Investigate a stale value bug\n4. Fix a connection switch\n5. Populate a chain of select boxes\nChallenge 1 of 5: Fix reconnecting on every keystroke \n\nIn this example, the ChatRoom component connects to the chat room when the component mounts, disconnects when it unmounts, and reconnects when you select a different chat room. This behavior is correct, so you need to keep it working.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. Whenever you type into the message box input at the bottom, ChatRoom also reconnects to the chat. (You can notice this by clearing the console and typing into the input.) Fix the issue so that this doesn’t happen.\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input\n        value={message}\n        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nShow hint\nShow solution\nNext Challenge\nPREVIOUS\nYou Might Not Need an Effect\nNEXT\nSeparating Events from Effects"

    "html": "ESCAPE HATCHES\nYou Might Not Need an Effect\n\nEffects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you “step outside” of React and synchronize your components with some external system like a non-React widget, network, or the browser DOM. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component’s state when some props or state change), you shouldn’t need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.\n\nYou will learn\nWhy and how to remove unnecessary Effects from your components\nHow to cache expensive computations without Effects\nHow to reset and adjust component state without Effects\nHow to share logic between event handlers\nWhich logic should be moved to event handlers\nHow to notify parent components about changes\nHow to remove unnecessary Effects \n\nThere are two common cases in which you don’t need Effects:\n\nYou don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering. For example, let’s say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will “commit” these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect also immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.\nYou don’t need Effects to handle user events. For example, let’s say you want to send an /api/buy POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product. In the Buy button click event handler, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don’t know what the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you’ll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers.\n\nYou do need Effects to synchronize with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state. You can also fetch data with Effects: for example, you can synchronize the search results with the current search query. Keep in mind that modern frameworks provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than writing Effects directly in your components.\n\nTo help you gain the right intuition, let’s look at some common concrete examples!\n\nUpdating state based on props or state \n\nSuppose you have a component with two state variables: firstName and lastName. You want to calculate a fullName from them by concatenating them. Moreover, you’d like fullName to update whenever firstName or lastName change. Your first instinct might be to add a fullName state variable and update it in an Effect:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect\n\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);\n\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for fullName, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove the state variable and the Effect:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');\n\n  // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering\n\n  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhen something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don’t put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering. This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra “cascading” updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other). If this approach feels new to you, Thinking in React explains what should go into state.\n\nCaching expensive calculations \n\nThis component computes visibleTodos by taking the todos it receives by props and filtering them according to the filter prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in state and update it from an Effect:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, filter }) {\n\n  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect\n\n  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setVisibleTodos(getFilteredTodos(todos, filter));\n\n  }, [todos, filter]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nLike in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, filter }) {\n\n  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');\n\n  // ✅ This is fine if getFilteredTodos() is not slow.\n\n  const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nUsually, this code is fine! But maybe getFilteredTodos() is slow or you have a lot of todos. In that case you don’t want to recalculate getFilteredTodos() if some unrelated state variable like newTodo has changed.\n\nYou can cache (or “memoize”) an expensive calculation by wrapping it in a useMemo Hook:\n\nimport { useMemo, useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, filter }) {\n\n  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    // ✅ Does not re-run unless todos or filter change\n\n    return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);\n\n  }, [todos, filter]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nOr, written as a single line:\n\nimport { useMemo, useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, filter }) {\n\n  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');\n\n  // ✅ Does not re-run getFilteredTodos() unless todos or filter change\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis tells React that you don’t want the inner function to re-run unless either todos or filter have changed. React will remember the return value of getFilteredTodos() during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if todos or filter are different. If they’re the same as last time, useMemo will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the inner function again (and store its result).\n\nThe function you wrap in useMemo runs during rendering, so this only works for pure calculations.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to tell if a calculation is expensive? \nShow Details\nResetting all state when a prop changes \n\nThis ProfilePage component receives a userId prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a comment state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the comment state does not get reset. As a result, it’s easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user’s profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the comment state variable whenever the userId changes:\n\nexport default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {\n\n  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setComment('');\n\n  }, [userId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis is inefficient because ProfilePage and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you’d need to do this in every component that has some state inside ProfilePage. For example, if the comment UI is nested, you’d want to clear out nested comment state too.\n\nInstead, you can tell React that each user’s profile is conceptually a different profile by giving it an explicit key. Split your component in two and pass a key attribute from the outer component to the inner one:\n\nexport default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Profile\n\n      userId={userId}\n\n      key={userId}\n\n    />\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Profile({ userId }) {\n\n  // ✅ This and any other state below will reset on key change automatically\n\n  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNormally, React preserves the state when the same component is rendered in the same spot. By passing userId as a key to the Profile component, you’re asking React to treat two Profile components with different userId as two different components that should not share any state. Whenever the key (which you’ve set to userId) changes, React will recreate the DOM and reset the state of the Profile component and all of its children. Now the comment field will clear out automatically when navigating between profiles.\n\nNote that in this example, only the outer ProfilePage component is exported and visible to other files in the project. Components rendering ProfilePage don’t need to pass the key to it: they pass userId as a regular prop. The fact ProfilePage passes it as a key to the inner Profile component is an implementation detail.\n\nAdjusting some state when a prop changes \n\nSometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it.\n\nThis List component receives a list of items as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the selection state variable. You want to reset the selection to null whenever the items prop receives a different array:\n\nfunction List({ items }) {\n\n  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);\n\n  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setSelection(null);\n\n  }, [items]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis, too, is not ideal. Every time the items change, the List and its child components will render with a stale selection value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the setSelection(null) call will cause another re-render of the List and its child components, restarting this whole process again.\n\nStart by deleting the Effect. Instead, adjust the state directly during rendering:\n\nfunction List({ items }) {\n\n  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);\n\n  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  // Better: Adjust the state while rendering\n\n  const [prevItems, setPrevItems] = useState(items);\n\n  if (items !== prevItems) {\n\n    setPrevItems(items);\n\n    setSelection(null);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nStoring information from previous renders like this can be hard to understand, but it’s better than updating the same state in an Effect. In the above example, setSelection is called directly during a render. React will re-render the List immediately after it exits with a return statement. React has not rendered the List children or updated the DOM yet, so this lets the List children skip rendering the stale selection value.\n\nWhen you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering. To avoid very slow cascading retries, React only lets you update the same component’s state during a render. If you update another component’s state during a render, you’ll see an error. A condition like items !== prevItems is necessary to avoid loops. You may adjust state like this, but any other side effects (like changing the DOM or setting timeouts) should stay in event handlers or Effects to keep components pure.\n\nAlthough this pattern is more efficient than an Effect, most components shouldn’t need it either. No matter how you do it, adjusting state based on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can reset all state with a key or calculate everything during rendering instead. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected item, you can store the selected item ID:\n\nfunction List({ items }) {\n\n  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);\n\n  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);\n\n  // ✅ Best: Calculate everything during rendering\n\n  const selection = items.find(item => item.id === selectedId) ?? null;\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow there is no need to “adjust” the state at all. If the item with the selected ID is in the list, it remains selected. If it’s not, the selection calculated during rendering will be null because no matching item was found. This behavior is different, but arguably better because most changes to items preserve the selection.\n\nSharing logic between event handlers \n\nLet’s say you have a product page with two buttons (Buy and Checkout) that both let you buy that product. You want to show a notification whenever the user puts the product in the cart. Calling showNotification() in both buttons’ click handlers feels repetitive so you might be tempted to place this logic in an Effect:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (product.isInCart) {\n\n      showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);\n\n    }\n\n  }, [product]);\n\n\n\n  function handleBuyClick() {\n\n    addToCart(product);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleCheckoutClick() {\n\n    addToCart(product);\n\n    navigateTo('/checkout');\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis Effect is unnecessary. It will also most likely cause bugs. For example, let’s say that your app “remembers” the shopping cart between the page reloads. If you add a product to the cart once and refresh the page, the notification will appear again. It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product’s page. This is because product.isInCart will already be true on the page load, so the Effect above will call showNotification().\n\nWhen you’re not sure whether some code should be in an Effect or in an event handler, ask yourself why this code needs to run. Use Effects only for code that should run because the component was displayed to the user. In this example, the notification should appear because the user pressed the button, not because the page was displayed! Delete the Effect and put the shared logic into a function called from both event handlers:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers\n\n  function buyProduct() {\n\n    addToCart(product);\n\n    showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleBuyClick() {\n\n    buyProduct();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleCheckoutClick() {\n\n    buyProduct();\n\n    navigateTo('/checkout');\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis both removes the unnecessary Effect and fixes the bug.\n\nSending a POST request \n\nThis Form component sends two kinds of POST requests. It sends an analytics event when it mounts. When you fill in the form and click the Submit button, it will send a POST request to the /api/register endpoint:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  // ✅ Good: This logic should run because the component was displayed\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect\n\n  const [jsonToSubmit, setJsonToSubmit] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (jsonToSubmit !== null) {\n\n      post('/api/register', jsonToSubmit);\n\n    }\n\n  }, [jsonToSubmit]);\n\n\n\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    setJsonToSubmit({ firstName, lastName });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nLet’s apply the same criteria as in the example before.\n\nThe analytics POST request should remain in an Effect. This is because the reason to send the analytics event is that the form was displayed. (It would fire twice in development, but see here for how to deal with that.)\n\nHowever, the /api/register POST request is not caused by the form being displayed. You only want to send the request at one specific moment in time: when the user presses the button. It should only ever happen on that particular interaction. Delete the second Effect and move that POST request into the event handler:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  // ✅ Good: This logic runs because the component was displayed\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is in the event handler\n\n    post('/api/register', { firstName, lastName });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhen you choose whether to put some logic into an event handler or an Effect, the main question you need to answer is what kind of logic it is from the user’s perspective. If this logic is caused by a particular interaction, keep it in the event handler. If it’s caused by the user seeing the component on the screen, keep it in the Effect.\n\nChains of computations \n\nSometimes you might feel tempted to chain Effects that each adjust a piece of state based on other state:\n\nfunction Game() {\n\n  const [card, setCard] = useState(null);\n\n  const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const [round, setRound] = useState(1);\n\n  const [isGameOver, setIsGameOver] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Chains of Effects that adjust the state solely to trigger each other\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (card !== null && card.gold) {\n\n      setGoldCardCount(c => c + 1);\n\n    }\n\n  }, [card]);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (goldCardCount > 3) {\n\n      setRound(r => r + 1)\n\n      setGoldCardCount(0);\n\n    }\n\n  }, [goldCardCount]);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (round > 5) {\n\n      setIsGameOver(true);\n\n    }\n\n  }, [round]);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    alert('Good game!');\n\n  }, [isGameOver]);\n\n\n\n  function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) {\n\n    if (isGameOver) {\n\n      throw Error('Game already ended.');\n\n    } else {\n\n      setCard(nextCard);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nThere are two problems with this code.\n\nOne problem is that it is very inefficient: the component (and its children) have to re-render between each set call in the chain. In the example above, in the worst case (setCard → render → setGoldCardCount → render → setRound → render → setIsGameOver → render) there are three unnecessary re-renders of the tree below.\n\nEven if it weren’t slow, as your code evolves, you will run into cases where the “chain” you wrote doesn’t fit the new requirements. Imagine you are adding a way to step through the history of the game moves. You’d do it by updating each state variable to a value from the past. However, setting the card state to a value from the past would trigger the Effect chain again and change the data you’re showing. Such code is often rigid and fragile.\n\nIn this case, it’s better to calculate what you can during rendering, and adjust the state in the event handler:\n\nfunction Game() {\n\n  const [card, setCard] = useState(null);\n\n  const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const [round, setRound] = useState(1);\n\n\n\n  // ✅ Calculate what you can during rendering\n\n  const isGameOver = round > 5;\n\n\n\n  function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) {\n\n    if (isGameOver) {\n\n      throw Error('Game already ended.');\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    // ✅ Calculate all the next state in the event handler\n\n    setCard(nextCard);\n\n    if (nextCard.gold) {\n\n      if (goldCardCount <= 3) {\n\n        setGoldCardCount(goldCardCount + 1);\n\n      } else {\n\n        setGoldCardCount(0);\n\n        setRound(round + 1);\n\n        if (round === 5) {\n\n          alert('Good game!');\n\n        }\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is a lot more efficient. Also, if you implement a way to view game history, now you will be able to set each state variable to a move from the past without triggering the Effect chain that adjusts every other value. If you need to reuse logic between several event handlers, you can extract a function and call it from those handlers.\n\nRemember that inside event handlers, state behaves like a snapshot. For example, even after you call setRound(round + 1), the round variable will reflect the value at the time the user clicked the button. If you need to use the next value for calculations, define it manually like const nextRound = round + 1.\n\nIn some cases, you can’t calculate the next state directly in the event handler. For example, imagine a form with multiple dropdowns where the options of the next dropdown depend on the selected value of the previous dropdown. Then, a chain of Effects is appropriate because you are synchronizing with network.\n\nInitializing the application \n\nSome logic should only run once when the app loads.\n\nYou might be tempted to place it in an Effect in the top-level component:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Effects with logic that should only ever run once\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    loadDataFromLocalStorage();\n\n    checkAuthToken();\n\n  }, []);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nHowever, you’ll quickly discover that it runs twice in development. This can cause issues—for example, maybe it invalidates the authentication token because the function wasn’t designed to be called twice. In general, your components should be resilient to being remounted. This includes your top-level App component.\n\nAlthough it may not ever get remounted in practice in production, following the same constraints in all components makes it easier to move and reuse code. If some logic must run once per app load rather than once per component mount, add a top-level variable to track whether it has already executed:\n\nlet didInit = false;\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (!didInit) {\n\n      didInit = true;\n\n      // ✅ Only runs once per app load\n\n      loadDataFromLocalStorage();\n\n      checkAuthToken();\n\n    }\n\n  }, []);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou can also run it during module initialization and before the app renders:\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.\n\n   // ✅ Only runs once per app load\n\n  checkAuthToken();\n\n  loadDataFromLocalStorage();\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nCode at the top level runs once when your component is imported—even if it doesn’t end up being rendered. To avoid slowdown or surprising behavior when importing arbitrary components, don’t overuse this pattern. Keep app-wide initialization logic to root component modules like App.js or in your application’s entry point.\n\nNotifying parent components about state changes \n\nLet’s say you’re writing a Toggle component with an internal isOn state which can be either true or false. There are a few different ways to toggle it (by clicking or dragging). You want to notify the parent component whenever the Toggle internal state changes, so you expose an onChange event and call it from an Effect:\n\nfunction Toggle({ onChange }) {\n\n  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: The onChange handler runs too late\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onChange(isOn);\n\n  }, [isOn, onChange])\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setIsOn(!isOn);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleDragEnd(e) {\n\n    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {\n\n      setIsOn(true);\n\n    } else {\n\n      setIsOn(false);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nLike earlier, this is not ideal. The Toggle updates its state first, and React updates the screen. Then React runs the Effect, which calls the onChange function passed from a parent component. Now the parent component will update its own state, starting another render pass. It would be better to do everything in a single pass.\n\nDelete the Effect and instead update the state of both components within the same event handler:\n\nfunction Toggle({ onChange }) {\n\n  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  function updateToggle(nextIsOn) {\n\n    // ✅ Good: Perform all updates during the event that caused them\n\n    setIsOn(nextIsOn);\n\n    onChange(nextIsOn);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    updateToggle(!isOn);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleDragEnd(e) {\n\n    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {\n\n      updateToggle(true);\n\n    } else {\n\n      updateToggle(false);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWith this approach, both the Toggle component and its parent component update their state during the event. React batches updates from different components together, so there will only be one render pass.\n\nYou might also be able to remove the state altogether, and instead receive isOn from the parent component:\n\n// ✅ Also good: the component is fully controlled by its parent\n\nfunction Toggle({ isOn, onChange }) {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    onChange(!isOn);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleDragEnd(e) {\n\n    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {\n\n      onChange(true);\n\n    } else {\n\n      onChange(false);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n“Lifting state up” lets the parent component fully control the Toggle by toggling the parent’s own state. This means the parent component will have to contain more logic, but there will be less state overall to worry about. Whenever you try to keep two different state variables synchronized, try lifting state up instead!\n\nPassing data to the parent \n\nThis Child component fetches some data and then passes it to the Parent component in an Effect:\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return <Child onFetched={setData} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Child({ onFetched }) {\n\n  const data = useSomeAPI();\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Passing data to the parent in an Effect\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (data) {\n\n      onFetched(data);\n\n    }\n\n  }, [onFetched, data]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIn React, data flows from the parent components to their children. When you see something wrong on the screen, you can trace where the information comes from by going up the component chain until you find which component passes the wrong prop or has the wrong state. When child components update the state of their parent components in Effects, the data flow becomes very difficult to trace. Since both the child and the parent need the same data, let the parent component fetch that data, and pass it down to the child instead:\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const data = useSomeAPI();\n\n  // ...\n\n  // ✅ Good: Passing data down to the child\n\n  return <Child data={data} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Child({ data }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis is simpler and keeps the data flow predictable: the data flows down from the parent to the child.\n\nSubscribing to an external store \n\nSometimes, your components may need to subscribe to some data outside of the React state. This data could be from a third-party library or a built-in browser API. Since this data can change without React’s knowledge, you need to manually subscribe your components to it. This is often done with an Effect, for example:\n\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  // Not ideal: Manual store subscription in an Effect\n\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    function updateState() {\n\n      setIsOnline(navigator.onLine);\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    updateState();\n\n\n\n    window.addEventListener('online', updateState);\n\n    window.addEventListener('offline', updateState);\n\n    return () => {\n\n      window.removeEventListener('online', updateState);\n\n      window.removeEventListener('offline', updateState);\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nHere, the component subscribes to an external data store (in this case, the browser navigator.onLine API). Since this API does not exist on the server (so it can’t be used for the initial HTML), initially the state is set to true. Whenever the value of that data store changes in the browser, the component updates its state.\n\nAlthough it’s common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. Delete the Effect and replace it with a call to useSyncExternalStore:\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  return () => {\n\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  };\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Subscribing to an external store with a built-in Hook\n\n  return useSyncExternalStore(\n\n    subscribe, // React won't resubscribe for as long as you pass the same function\n\n    () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client\n\n    () => true // How to get the value on the server\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis approach is less error-prone than manually syncing mutable data to React state with an Effect. Typically, you’ll write a custom Hook like useOnlineStatus() above so that you don’t need to repeat this code in the individual components. Read more about subscribing to external stores from React components.\n\nFetching data \n\nMany apps use Effects to kick off data fetching. It is quite common to write a data fetching Effect like this:\n\nfunction SearchResults({ query }) {\n\n  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // 🔴 Avoid: Fetching without cleanup logic\n\n    fetchResults(query, page).then(json => {\n\n      setResults(json);\n\n    });\n\n  }, [query, page]);\n\n\n\n  function handleNextPageClick() {\n\n    setPage(page + 1);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou don’t need to move this fetch to an event handler.\n\nThis might seem like a contradiction with the earlier examples where you needed to put the logic into the event handlers! However, consider that it’s not the typing event that’s the main reason to fetch. Search inputs are often prepopulated from the URL, and the user might navigate Back and Forward without touching the input.\n\nIt doesn’t matter where page and query come from. While this component is visible, you want to keep results synchronized with data from the network for the current page and query. This is why it’s an Effect.\n\nHowever, the code above has a bug. Imagine you type \"hello\" fast. Then the query will change from \"h\", to \"he\", \"hel\", \"hell\", and \"hello\". This will kick off separate fetches, but there is no guarantee about which order the responses will arrive in. For example, the \"hell\" response may arrive after the \"hello\" response. Since it will call setResults() last, you will be displaying the wrong search results. This is called a “race condition”: two different requests “raced” against each other and came in a different order than you expected.\n\nTo fix the race condition, you need to add a cleanup function to ignore stale responses:\n\nfunction SearchResults({ query }) {\n\n  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    fetchResults(query, page).then(json => {\n\n      if (!ignore) {\n\n        setResults(json);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [query, page]);\n\n\n\n  function handleNextPageClick() {\n\n    setPage(page + 1);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that when your Effect fetches data, all responses except the last requested one will be ignored.\n\nHandling race conditions is not the only difficulty with implementing data fetching. You might also want to think about caching responses (so that the user can click Back and see the previous screen instantly), how to fetch data on the server (so that the initial server-rendered HTML contains the fetched content instead of a spinner), and how to avoid network waterfalls (so that a child can fetch data without waiting for every parent).\n\nThese issues apply to any UI library, not just React. Solving them is not trivial, which is why modern frameworks provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than fetching data in Effects.\n\nIf you don’t use a framework (and don’t want to build your own) but would like to make data fetching from Effects more ergonomic, consider extracting your fetching logic into a custom Hook like in this example:\n\nfunction SearchResults({ query }) {\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);\n\n  const params = new URLSearchParams({ query, page });\n\n  const results = useData(`/api/search?${params}`);\n\n\n\n  function handleNextPageClick() {\n\n    setPage(page + 1);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction useData(url) {\n\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    fetch(url)\n\n      .then(response => response.json())\n\n      .then(json => {\n\n        if (!ignore) {\n\n          setData(json);\n\n        }\n\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n\n}\n\nYou’ll likely also want to add some logic for error handling and to track whether the content is loading. You can build a Hook like this yourself or use one of the many solutions already available in the React ecosystem. Although this alone won’t be as efficient as using a framework’s built-in data fetching mechanism, moving the data fetching logic into a custom Hook will make it easier to adopt an efficient data fetching strategy later.\n\nIn general, whenever you have to resort to writing Effects, keep an eye out for when you can extract a piece of functionality into a custom Hook with a more declarative and purpose-built API like useData above. The fewer raw useEffect calls you have in your components, the easier you will find to maintain your application.\n\nRecap\nIf you can calculate something during render, you don’t need an Effect.\nTo cache expensive calculations, add useMemo instead of useEffect.\nTo reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different key to it.\nTo reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering.\nCode that runs because a component was displayed should be in Effects, the rest should be in events.\nIf you need to update the state of several components, it’s better to do it during a single event.\nWhenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up.\nYou can fetch data with Effects, but you need to implement cleanup to avoid race conditions.\nTry out some challenges\n1.

    "html": "ESCAPE HATCHES\nSynchronizing with Effects\n\nSome components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.\n\nYou will learn\nWhat Effects are\nHow Effects are different from events\nHow to declare an Effect in your component\nHow to skip re-running an Effect unnecessarily\nWhy Effects run twice in development and how to fix them\nWhat are Effects and how are they different from events? \n\nBefore getting to Effects, you need to be familiar with two types of logic inside React components:\n\nRendering code (introduced in Describing the UI) lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. Rendering code must be pure. Like a math formula, it should only calculate the result, but not do anything else.\n\nEvent handlers (introduced in Adding Interactivity) are nested functions inside your components that do things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain “side effects” (they change the program’s state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).\n\nSometimes this isn’t enough. Consider a ChatRoom component that must connect to the chat server whenever it’s visible on the screen. Connecting to a server is not a pure calculation (it’s a side effect) so it can’t happen during rendering. However, there is no single particular event like a click that causes ChatRoom to be displayed.\n\nEffects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event. Sending a message in the chat is an event because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection is an Effect because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a commit after the screen updates. This is a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library).\n\nNote\n\nHere and later in this text, capitalized “Effect” refers to the React-specific definition above, i.e. a side effect caused by rendering. To refer to the broader programming concept, we’ll say “side effect”.\n\nYou might not need an Effect \n\nDon’t rush to add Effects to your components. Keep in mind that Effects are typically used to “step out” of your React code and synchronize with some external system. This includes browser APIs, third-party widgets, network, and so on. If your Effect only adjusts some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.\n\nHow to write an Effect \n\nTo write an Effect, follow these three steps:\n\nDeclare an Effect. By default, your Effect will run after every render.\nSpecify the Effect dependencies. Most Effects should only re-run when needed rather than after every render. For example, a fade-in animation should only trigger when a component appears. Connecting and disconnecting to a chat room should only happen when the component appears and disappears, or when the chat room changes. You will learn how to control this by specifying dependencies.\nAdd cleanup if needed. Some Effects need to specify how to stop, undo, or clean up whatever they were doing. For example, “connect” needs “disconnect”, “subscribe” needs “unsubscribe”, and “fetch” needs either “cancel” or “ignore”. You will learn how to do this by returning a cleanup function.\n\nLet’s look at each of these steps in detail.\n\nStep 1: Declare an Effect \n\nTo declare an Effect in your component, import the useEffect Hook from React:\n\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\n\nThen, call it at the top level of your component and put some code inside your Effect:\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // Code here will run after *every* render\n\n  });\n\n  return <div />;\n\n}\n\nEvery time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code inside useEffect. In other words, useEffect “delays” a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.\n\nLet’s see how you can use an Effect to synchronize with an external system. Consider a <VideoPlayer> React component. It would be nice to control whether it’s playing or paused by passing an isPlaying prop to it:\n\n<VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} />;\n\nYour custom VideoPlayer component renders the built-in browser <video> tag:\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n\n  // TODO: do something with isPlaying\n\n  return <video src={src} />;\n\n}\n\nHowever, the browser <video> tag does not have an isPlaying prop. The only way to control it is to manually call the play() and pause() methods on the DOM element. You need to synchronize the value of isPlaying prop, which tells whether the video should currently be playing, with calls like play() and pause().\n\nWe’ll need to first get a ref to the <video> DOM node.\n\nYou might be tempted to try to call play() or pause() during rendering, but that isn’t correct:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  if (isPlaying) {\n    ref.current.play();  // Calling these while rendering isn't allowed.\n  } else {\n    ref.current.pause(); // Also, this crashes.\n  }\n\n  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>\n        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}\n      </button>\n      <VideoPlayer\n        isPlaying={isPlaying}\n        src=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe reason this code isn’t correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React, rendering should be a pure calculation of JSX and should not contain side effects like modifying the DOM.\n\nMoreover, when VideoPlayer is called for the first time, its DOM does not exist yet! There isn’t a DOM node yet to call play() or pause() on, because React doesn’t know what DOM to create until you return the JSX.\n\nThe solution here is to wrap the side effect with useEffect to move it out of the rendering calculation:\n\nimport { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (isPlaying) {\n\n      ref.current.play();\n\n    } else {\n\n      ref.current.pause();\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;\n\n}\n\nBy wrapping the DOM update in an Effect, you let React update the screen first. Then your Effect runs.\n\nWhen your VideoPlayer component renders (either the first time or if it re-renders), a few things will happen. First, React will update the screen, ensuring the <video> tag is in the DOM with the right props. Then React will run your Effect. Finally, your Effect will call play() or pause() depending on the value of isPlaying.\n\nPress Play/Pause multiple times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the isPlaying value:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isPlaying) {\n      ref.current.play();\n    } else {\n      ref.current.pause();\n    }\n  });\n\n  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>\n        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}\n      </button>\n      <VideoPlayer\n        isPlaying={isPlaying}\n        src=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn this example, the “external system” you synchronized to React state was the browser media API. You can use a similar approach to wrap legacy non-React code (like jQuery plugins) into declarative React components.\n\nNote that controlling a video player is much more complex in practice. Calling play() may fail, the user might play or pause using the built-in browser controls, and so on. This example is very simplified and incomplete.\n\nPitfall\n\nBy default, Effects run after every render. This is why code like this will produce an infinite loop:\n\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  setCount(count + 1);\n\n});\n\nEffects run as a result of rendering. Setting state triggers rendering. Setting state immediately in an Effect is like plugging a power outlet into itself. The Effect runs, it sets the state, which causes a re-render, which causes the Effect to run, it sets the state again, this causes another re-render, and so on.\n\nEffects should usually synchronize your components with an external system. If there’s no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.\n\nStep 2: Specify the Effect dependencies \n\nBy default, Effects run after every render. Often, this is not what you want:\n\nSometimes, it’s slow. Synchronizing with an external system is not always instant, so you might want to skip doing it unless it’s necessary. For example, you don’t want to reconnect to the chat server on every keystroke.\nSometimes, it’s wrong. For example, you don’t want to trigger a component fade-in animation on every keystroke. The animation should only play once when the component appears for the first time.\n\nTo demonstrate the issue, here is the previous example with a few console.log calls and a text input that updates the parent component’s state. Notice how typing causes the Effect to re-run:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isPlaying) {\n      console.log('Calling video.play()');\n      ref.current.play();\n    } else {\n      console.log('Calling video.pause()');\n      ref.current.pause();\n    }\n  });\n\n  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>\n        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}\n      </button>\n      <VideoPlayer\n        isPlaying={isPlaying}\n        src=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can tell React to skip unnecessarily re-running the Effect by specifying an array of dependencies as the second argument to the useEffect call. Start by adding an empty [] array to the above example on line 14:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, []);\n\nYou should see an error saying React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying':\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isPlaying) {\n      console.log('Calling video.play()');\n      ref.current.play();\n    } else {\n      console.log('Calling video.pause()');\n      ref.current.pause();\n    }\n  }, []); // This causes an error\n\n  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>\n        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}\n      </button>\n      <VideoPlayer\n        isPlaying={isPlaying}\n        src=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe problem is that the code inside of your Effect depends on the isPlaying prop to decide what to do, but this dependency was not explicitly declared. To fix this issue, add isPlaying to the dependency array:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    if (isPlaying) { // It's used here...\n\n      // ...\n\n    } else {\n\n      // ...\n\n    }\n\n  }, [isPlaying]); // ...so it must be declared here!\n\nNow all dependencies are declared, so there is no error. Specifying [isPlaying] as the dependency array tells React that it should skip re-running your Effect if isPlaying is the same as it was during the previous render. With this change, typing into the input doesn’t cause the Effect to re-run, but pressing Play/Pause does:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isPlaying) {\n      console.log('Calling video.play()');\n      ref.current.play();\n    } else {\n      console.log('Calling video.pause()');\n      ref.current.pause();\n    }\n  }, [isPlaying]);\n\n  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>\n        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}\n      </button>\n      <VideoPlayer\n        isPlaying={isPlaying}\n        src=\"https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4\"\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe dependency array can contain multiple dependencies. React will only skip re-running the Effect if all of the dependencies you specify have exactly the same values as they had during the previous render. React compares the dependency values using the Object.is comparison. See the useEffect reference for details.\n\nNotice that you can’t “choose” your dependencies. You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don’t match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect. This helps catch many bugs in your code. If you don’t want some code to re-run, edit the Effect code itself to not “need” that dependency.\n\nPitfall\n\nThe behaviors without the dependency array and with an empty [] dependency array are different:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // This runs after every render\n\n});\n\n\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // This runs only on mount (when the component appears)\n\n}, []);\n\n\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // This runs on mount *and also* if either a or b have changed since the last render\n\n}, [a, b]);\n\nWe’ll take a close look at what “mount” means in the next step.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy was the ref omitted from the dependency array? \nShow Details\nStep 3: Add cleanup if needed \n\nConsider a different example. You’re writing a ChatRoom component that needs to connect to the chat server when it appears. You are given a createConnection() API that returns an object with connect() and disconnect() methods. How do you keep the component connected while it is displayed to the user?\n\nStart by writing the Effect logic:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  const connection = createConnection();\n\n  connection.connect();\n\n});\n\nIt would be slow to connect to the chat after every re-render, so you add the dependency array:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  const connection = createConnection();\n\n  connection.connect();\n\n}, []);\n\nThe code inside the Effect does not use any props or state, so your dependency array is [] (empty). This tells React to only run this code when the component “mounts”, i.e. appears on the screen for the first time.\n\nLet’s try running this code:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection();\n    connection.connect();\n  }, []);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nThis Effect only runs on mount, so you might expect \"✅ Connecting...\" to be printed once in the console. However, if you check the console, \"✅ Connecting...\" gets printed twice. Why does it happen?\n\nImagine the ChatRoom component is a part of a larger app with many different screens. The user starts their journey on the ChatRoom page. The component mounts and calls connection.connect(). Then imagine the user navigates to another screen—for example, to the Settings page. The ChatRoom component unmounts. Finally, the user clicks Back and ChatRoom mounts again. This would set up a second connection—but the first connection was never destroyed! As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up.\n\nBugs like this are easy to miss without extensive manual testing. To help you spot them quickly, in development React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount.\n\nSeeing the \"✅ Connecting...\" log twice helps you notice the real issue: your code doesn’t close the connection when the component unmounts.\n\nTo fix the issue, return a cleanup function from your Effect:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\nReact will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed). Let’s see what happens when the cleanup function is implemented:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection();\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, []);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nNow you get three console logs in development:\n\n\"✅ Connecting...\"\n\"❌ Disconnected.\"\n\"✅ Connecting...\"\n\nThis is the correct behavior in development. By remounting your component, React verifies that navigating away and back would not break your code. Disconnecting and then connecting again is exactly what should happen! When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again. There’s an extra connect/disconnect call pair because React is probing your code for bugs in development. This is normal—don’t try to make it go away!\n\nIn production, you would only see \"✅ Connecting...\" printed once. Remounting components only happens in development to help you find Effects that need cleanup. You can turn off Strict Mode to opt out of the development behavior, but we recommend keeping it on. This lets you find many bugs like the one above.\n\nHow to handle the Effect firing twice in development? \n\nReact intentionally remounts your components in development to find bugs like in the last example. The right question isn’t “how to run an Effect once”, but “how to fix my Effect so that it works after remounting”.\n\nUsually, the answer is to implement the cleanup function.  The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the Effect was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the Effect running once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as you’d see in development).\n\nMost of the Effects you’ll write will fit into one of the common patterns below.\n\nControlling non-React widgets \n\nSometimes you need to add UI widgets that aren’t written to React. For example, let’s say you’re adding a map component to your page. It has a setZoomLevel() method, and you’d like to keep the zoom level in sync with a zoomLevel state variable in your React code. Your Effect would look similar to this:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  const map = mapRef.current;\n\n  map.setZoomLevel(zoomLevel);\n\n}, [zoomLevel]);\n\nNote that there is no cleanup needed in this case. In development, React will call the Effect twice, but this is not a problem because calling setZoomLevel twice with the same value does not do anything. It may be slightly slower, but this doesn’t matter because it won’t remount needlessly in production.\n\nSome APIs may not allow you to call them twice in a row. For example, the showModal method of the built-in <dialog> element throws if you call it twice. Implement the cleanup function and make it close the dialog:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  const dialog = dialogRef.current;\n\n  dialog.showModal();\n\n  return () => dialog.close();\n\n}, []);\n\nIn development, your Effect will call showModal(), then immediately close(), and then showModal() again. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling showModal() once, as you would see in production.\n\nSubscribing to events \n\nIf your Effect subscribes to something, the cleanup function should unsubscribe:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  function handleScroll(e) {\n\n    console.log(window.scrollX, window.scrollY);\n\n  }\n\n  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);\n\n  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);\n\n}, []);\n\nIn development, your Effect will call addEventListener(), then immediately removeEventListener(), and then addEventListener() again with the same handler. So there would be only one active subscription at a time. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling addEventListener() once, as in production.\n\nTriggering animations \n\nIf your Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should reset the animation to the initial values:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  const node = ref.current;\n\n  node.style.opacity = 1; // Trigger the animation\n\n  return () => {\n\n    node.style.opacity = 0; // Reset to the initial value\n\n  };\n\n}, []);\n\nIn development, opacity will be set to 1, then to 0, and then to 1 again. This should have the same user-visible behavior as setting it to 1 directly, which is what would happen in production. If you use a third-party animation library with support for tweening, your cleanup function should reset the timeline to its initial state.\n\nFetching data \n\nIf your Effect fetches something, the cleanup function should either abort the fetch or ignore its result:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  let ignore = false;\n\n\n\n  async function startFetching() {\n\n    const json = await fetchTodos(userId);\n\n    if (!ignore) {\n\n      setTodos(json);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  startFetching();\n\n\n\n  return () => {\n\n    ignore = true;\n\n  };\n\n}, [userId]);\n\nYou can’t “undo” a network request that already happened, but your cleanup function should ensure that the fetch that’s not relevant anymore does not keep affecting your application. If the userId changes from 'Alice' to 'Bob', cleanup ensures that the 'Alice' response is ignored even if it arrives after 'Bob'.\n\nIn development, you will see two fetches in the Network tab. There is nothing wrong with that. With the approach above, the first Effect will immediately get cleaned up so its copy of the ignore variable will be set to true. So even though there is an extra request, it won’t affect the state thanks to the if (!ignore) check.\n\nIn production, there will only be one request. If the second request in development is bothering you, the best approach is to use a solution that deduplicates requests and caches their responses between components:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const todos = useSomeDataLibrary(`/api/user/${userId}/todos`);\n\n  // ...\n\nThis will not only improve the development experience, but also make your application feel faster. For example, the user pressing the Back button won’t have to wait for some data to load again because it will be cached. You can either build such a cache yourself or use one of the many alternatives to manual fetching in Effects.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhat are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? \nShow Details\nSending analytics \n\nConsider this code that sends an analytics event on the page visit:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  logVisit(url); // Sends a POST request\n\n}, [url]);\n\nIn development, logVisit will be called twice for every URL, so you might be tempted to try to fix that. We recommend keeping this code as is. Like with earlier examples, there is no user-visible behavior difference between running it once and running it twice. From a practical point of view, logVisit should not do anything in development because you don’t want the logs from the development machines to skew the production metrics. Your component remounts every time you save its file, so it logs extra visits in development anyway.\n\nIn production, there will be no duplicate visit logs.\n\nTo debug the analytics events you’re sending, you can deploy your app to a staging environment (which runs in production mode) or temporarily opt out of Strict Mode and its development-only remounting checks. You may also send analytics from the route change event handlers instead of Effects. For more precise analytics, intersection observers can help track which components are in the viewport and how long they remain visible.\n\nNot an Effect: Initializing the application \n\nSome logic should only run once when the application starts. You can put it outside your components:\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.\n\n  checkAuthToken();\n\n  loadDataFromLocalStorage();\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis guarantees that such logic only runs once after the browser loads the page.\n\nNot an Effect: Buying a product \n\nSometimes, even if you write a cleanup function, there’s no way to prevent user-visible consequences of running the Effect twice. For example, maybe your Effect sends a POST request like buying a product:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // 🔴 Wrong: This Effect fires twice in development, exposing a problem in the code.\n\n  fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' });\n\n}, []);\n\nYou wouldn’t want to buy the product twice. However, this is also why you shouldn’t put this logic in an Effect. What if the user goes to another page and then presses Back? Your Effect would run again. You don’t want to buy the product when the user visits a page; you want to buy it when the user clicks the Buy button.\n\nBuying is not caused by rendering; it’s caused by a specific interaction. It should run only when the user presses the button. Delete the Effect and move your /api/buy request into the Buy button event handler:\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    // ✅ Buying is an event because it is caused by a particular interaction.\n\n    fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' });\n\n  }\n\nThis illustrates that if remounting breaks the logic of your application, this usually uncovers existing bugs. From a user’s perspective, visiting a page shouldn’t be different from visiting it, clicking a link, then pressing Back to view the page again. React verifies that your components abide by this principle by remounting them once in development.\n\nPutting it all together \n\nThis playground can help you “get a feel” for how Effects work in practice.\n\nThis example uses setTimeout to schedule a console log with the input text to appear three seconds after the Effect runs. The cleanup function cancels the pending timeout. Start by pressing “Mount the component”:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction Playground() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('a');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function onTimeout() {\n      console.log('⏰ ' + text);\n    }\n\n    console.log('🔵 Schedule \"' + text + '\" log');\n    const timeoutId = setTimeout(onTimeout, 3000);\n\n    return () => {\n      console.log('🟡 Cancel \"' + text + '\" log');\n      clearTimeout(timeoutId);\n    };\n  }, [text]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        What to log:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={text}\n          onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>{text}</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Unmount' : 'Mount'} the component\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <Playground />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou will see three logs at first: Schedule \"a\" log, Cancel \"a\" log, and Schedule \"a\" log again. Three second later there will also be a log saying a. As you learned earlier, the extra schedule/cancel pair is because React remounts the component once in development to verify that you’ve implemented cleanup well.\n\nNow edit the input to say abc. If you do it fast enough, you’ll see Schedule \"ab\" log immediately followed by Cancel \"ab\" log and Schedule \"abc\" log. React always cleans up the previous render’s Effect before the next render’s Effect. This is why even if you type into the input fast, there is at most one timeout scheduled at a time. Edit the input a few times and watch the console to get a feel for how Effects get cleaned up.\n\nType something into the input and then immediately press “Unmount the component”. Notice how unmounting cleans up the last render’s Effect. Here, it clears the last timeout before it has a chance to fire.\n\nFinally, edit the component above and comment out the cleanup function so that the timeouts don’t get cancelled. Try typing abcde fast. What do you expect to happen in three seconds? Will console.log(text) inside the timeout print the latest text and produce five abcde logs? Give it a try to check your intuition!\n\nThree seconds later, you should see a sequence of logs (a, ab, abc, abcd, and abcde) rather than five abcde logs. Each Effect “captures” the text value from its corresponding render.  It doesn’t matter that the text state changed: an Effect from the render with text = 'ab' will always see 'ab'. In other words, Effects from each render are isolated from each other. If you’re curious how this works, you can read about closures.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nEach render has its own Effects \nShow Details\nRecap\nUnlike events, Effects are caused by rendering itself rather than a particular interaction.\nEffects let you synchronize a component with some external system (third-party API, network, etc).\nBy default, Effects run after every render (including the initial one).\nReact will skip the Effect if all of its dependencies have the same values as during the last render.\nYou can’t “choose” your dependencies. They are determined by the code inside the Effect.\nEmpty dependency array ([]) corresponds to the component “mounting”, i.e. being added to the screen.\nIn Strict Mode, React mounts components twice (in development only!) to stress-test your Effects.\nIf your Effect breaks because of remounting, you need to implement a cleanup function.\nReact will call your cleanup function before the Effect runs next time, and during the unmount.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Focus a field on mount\n2. Focus a field conditionally\n3. Fix an interval that fires twice\n4. Fix fetching inside an Effect\nChallenge 1 of 4: Focus a field on mount \n\nIn this example, the form renders a <MyInput /> component.\n\nUse the input’s focus() method to make MyInput automatically focus when it appears on the screen. There is already a commented out implementation, but it doesn’t quite work. Figure out why it doesn’t work, and fix it. (If you’re familiar with the autoFocus attribute, pretend that it does not exist: we are reimplementing the same functionality from scratch.)\n\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyInput({ value, onChange }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  // TODO: This doesn't quite work. Fix it.\n  // ref.current.focus()    \n\n  return (\n    <input\n      ref={ref}\n      value={value}\n      onChange={onChange}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo verify that your solution works, press “Show form” and verify that the input receives focus (becomes highlighted and the cursor is placed inside). Press “Hide form” and “Show form” again. Verify the input is highlighted again.\n\nMyInput should only focus on mount rather than after every render. To verify that the behavior is right, press “Show form” and then repeatedly press the “Make it uppercase” checkbox. Clicking the checkbox should not focus the input above it.\n\nShow solution\nNext Challenge\nPREVIOUS\nManipulating the DOM with Refs\nNEXT\nYou Might Not Need an Effect"

    "html": "ESCAPE HATCHES\nManipulating the DOM with Refs\n\nReact automatically updates the DOM to match your render output, so your components won’t often need to manipulate it. However, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React—for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to access a DOM node managed by React with the ref attribute\nHow the ref JSX attribute relates to the useRef Hook\nHow to access another component’s DOM node\nIn which cases it’s safe to modify the DOM managed by React\nGetting a ref to the node \n\nTo access a DOM node managed by React, first, import the useRef Hook:\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nThen, use it to declare a ref inside your component:\n\nconst myRef = useRef(null);\n\nFinally, pass your ref as the ref attribute to the JSX tag for which you want to get the DOM node:\n\n<div ref={myRef}>\n\nThe useRef Hook returns an object with a single property called current. Initially, myRef.current will be null. When React creates a DOM node for this <div>, React will put a reference to this node into myRef.current. You can then access this DOM node from your event handlers and use the built-in browser APIs defined on it.\n\n// You can use any browser APIs, for example:\n\nmyRef.current.scrollIntoView();\nExample: Focusing a text input \n\nIn this example, clicking the button will focus the input:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input ref={inputRef} />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Focus the input\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo implement this:\n\nDeclare inputRef with the useRef Hook.\nPass it as <input ref={inputRef}>. This tells React to put this <input>’s DOM node into inputRef.current.\nIn the handleClick function, read the input DOM node from inputRef.current and call focus() on it with inputRef.current.focus().\nPass the handleClick event handler to <button> with onClick.\n\nWhile DOM manipulation is the most common use case for refs, the useRef Hook can be used for storing other things outside React, like timer IDs. Similarly to state, refs remain between renders. Refs are like state variables that don’t trigger re-renders when you set them. Read about refs in Referencing Values with Refs.\n\nExample: Scrolling to an element \n\nYou can have more than a single ref in a component. In this example, there is a carousel of three images. Each button centers an image by calling the browser scrollIntoView() method on the corresponding DOM node:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function CatFriends() {\n  const firstCatRef = useRef(null);\n  const secondCatRef = useRef(null);\n  const thirdCatRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleScrollToFirstCat() {\n    firstCatRef.current.scrollIntoView({\n      behavior: 'smooth',\n      block: 'nearest',\n      inline: 'center'\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleScrollToSecondCat() {\n    secondCatRef.current.scrollIntoView({\n      behavior: 'smooth',\n      block: 'nearest',\n      inline: 'center'\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleScrollToThirdCat() {\n    thirdCatRef.current.scrollIntoView({\n      behavior: 'smooth',\n      block: 'nearest',\n      inline: 'center'\n    });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <button onClick={handleScrollToFirstCat}>\n          Tom\n        </button>\n        <button onClick={handleScrollToSecondCat}>\n          Maru\n        </button>\n        <button onClick={handleScrollToThirdCat}>\n          Jellylorum\n        </button>\n      </nav>\n      <div>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <img\n              src=\"https://placekitten.com/g/200/200\"\n              alt=\"Tom\"\n              ref={firstCatRef}\n            />\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <img\n              src=\"https://placekitten.com/g/300/200\"\n              alt=\"Maru\"\n              ref={secondCatRef}\n            />\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <img\n              src=\"https://placekitten.com/g/250/200\"\n              alt=\"Jellylorum\"\n              ref={thirdCatRef}\n            />\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to manage a list of refs using a ref callback \nShow Details\nAccessing another component’s DOM nodes \n\nWhen you put a ref on a built-in component that outputs a browser element like <input />, React will set that ref’s current property to the corresponding DOM node (such as the actual <input /> in the browser).\n\nHowever, if you try to put a ref on your own component, like <MyInput />, by default you will get null. Here is an example demonstrating it. Notice how clicking the button does not focus the input:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nfunction MyInput(props) {\n  return <input {...props} />;\n}\n\nexport default function MyForm() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Focus the input\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo help you notice the issue, React also prints an error to the console:\n\nConsole\nWarning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?\n\nThis happens because by default React does not let a component access the DOM nodes of other components. Not even for its own children! This is intentional. Refs are an escape hatch that should be used sparingly. Manually manipulating another component’s DOM nodes makes your code even more fragile.\n\nInstead, components that want to expose their DOM nodes have to opt in to that behavior. A component can specify that it “forwards” its ref to one of its children. Here’s how MyInput can use the forwardRef API:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={ref} />;\n\n});\n\nThis is how it works:\n\n<MyInput ref={inputRef} /> tells React to put the corresponding DOM node into inputRef.current. However, it’s up to the MyInput component to opt into that—by default, it doesn’t.\nThe MyInput component is declared using forwardRef. This opts it into receiving the inputRef from above as the second ref argument which is declared after props.\nMyInput itself passes the ref it received to the <input> inside of it.\n\nNow clicking the button to focus the input works:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { forwardRef, useRef } from 'react';\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  return <input {...props} ref={ref} />;\n});\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Focus the input\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn design systems, it is a common pattern for low-level components like buttons, inputs, and so on, to forward their refs to their DOM nodes. On the other hand, high-level components like forms, lists, or page sections usually won’t expose their DOM nodes to avoid accidental dependencies on the DOM structure.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nExposing a subset of the API with an imperative handle \nShow Details\nWhen React attaches the refs \n\nIn React, every update is split in two phases:\n\nDuring render, React calls your components to figure out what should be on the screen.\nDuring commit, React applies changes to the DOM.\n\nIn general, you don’t want to access refs during rendering. That goes for refs holding DOM nodes as well. During the first render, the DOM nodes have not yet been created, so ref.current will be null. And during the rendering of updates, the DOM nodes haven’t been updated yet. So it’s too early to read them.\n\nReact sets ref.current during the commit. Before updating the DOM, React sets the affected ref.current values to null. After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.\n\nUsually, you will access refs from event handlers. If you want to do something with a ref, but there is no particular event to do it in, you might need an Effect. We will discuss effects on the next pages.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nFlushing state updates synchronously with flushSync \nShow Details\nBest practices for DOM manipulation with refs \n\nRefs are an escape hatch. You should only use them when you have to “step outside React”. Common examples of this include managing focus, scroll position, or calling browser APIs that React does not expose.\n\nIf you stick to non-destructive actions like focusing and scrolling, you shouldn’t encounter any problems. However, if you try to modify the DOM manually, you can risk conflicting with the changes React is making.\n\nTo illustrate this problem, this example includes a welcome message and two buttons. The first button toggles its presence using conditional rendering and state, as you would usually do in React. The second button uses the remove() DOM API to forcefully remove it from the DOM outside of React’s control.\n\nTry pressing “Toggle with setState” a few times. The message should disappear and appear again. Then press “Remove from the DOM”. This will forcefully remove it. Finally, press “Toggle with setState”:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          setShow(!show);\n        }}>\n        Toggle with setState\n      </button>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          ref.current.remove();\n        }}>\n        Remove from the DOM\n      </button>\n      {show && <p ref={ref}>Hello world</p>}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nAfter you’ve manually removed the DOM element, trying to use setState to show it again will lead to a crash. This is because you’ve changed the DOM, and React doesn’t know how to continue managing it correctly.\n\nAvoid changing DOM nodes managed by React. Modifying, adding children to, or removing children from elements that are managed by React can lead to inconsistent visual results or crashes like above.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that you can’t do it at all. It requires caution. You can safely modify parts of the DOM that React has no reason to update. For example, if some <div> is always empty in the JSX, React won’t have a reason to touch its children list. Therefore, it is safe to manually add or remove elements there.\n\nRecap\nRefs are a generic concept, but most often you’ll use them to hold DOM elements.\nYou instruct React to put a DOM node into myRef.current by passing <div ref={myRef}>.\nUsually, you will use refs for non-destructive actions like focusing, scrolling, or measuring DOM elements.\nA component doesn’t expose its DOM nodes by default. You can opt into exposing a DOM node by using forwardRef and passing the second ref argument down to a specific node.\nAvoid changing DOM nodes managed by React.\nIf you do modify DOM nodes managed by React, modify parts that React has no reason to update.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Play and pause the video\n2. Focus the search field\n3. Scrolling an image carousel\n4. Focus the search field with separate components\nChallenge 1 of 4: Play and pause the video \n\nIn this example, the button toggles a state variable to switch between a playing and a paused state. However, in order to actually play or pause the video, toggling state is not enough. You also need to call play() and pause() on the DOM element for the <video>. Add a ref to it, and make the button work.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function VideoPlayer() {\n  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    const nextIsPlaying = !isPlaying;\n    setIsPlaying(nextIsPlaying);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {isPlaying ?

For example, here is a ref to the value 0:\n\nconst ref = useRef(0);\n\nuseRef returns an object like this:\n\n{ \n\n  current: 0 // The value you passed to useRef\n\n}\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nYou can access the current value of that ref through the ref.current property. This value is intentionally mutable, meaning you can both read and write to it. It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. (This is what makes it an “escape hatch” from React’s one-way data flow—more on that below!)\n\nHere, a button will increment ref.current on every click:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  let ref = useRef(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current = ref.current + 1;\n    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      Click me!\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe ref points to a number, but, like state, you could point to anything: a string, an object, or even a function. Unlike state, ref is a plain JavaScript object with the current property that you can read and modify.\n\nNote that the component doesn’t re-render with every increment. Like state, refs are retained by React between re-renders. However, setting state re-renders a component. Changing a ref does not!\n\nExample: building a stopwatch \n\nYou can combine refs and state in a single component. For example, let’s make a stopwatch that the user can start or stop by pressing a button. In order to display how much time has passed since the user pressed “Start”, you will need to keep track of when the Start button was pressed and what the current time is. This information is used for rendering, so you’ll keep it in state:\n\nconst [startTime, setStartTime] = useState(null);\n\nconst [now, setNow] = useState(null);\n\nWhen the user presses “Start”, you’ll use setInterval in order to update the time every 10 milliseconds:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Stopwatch() {\n  const [startTime, setStartTime] = useState(null);\n  const [now, setNow] = useState(null);\n\n  function handleStart() {\n    // Start counting.\n    setStartTime(Date.now());\n    setNow(Date.now());\n\n    setInterval(() => {\n      // Update the current time every 10ms.\n      setNow(Date.now());\n    }, 10);\n  }\n\n  let secondsPassed = 0;\n  if (startTime != null && now != null) {\n    secondsPassed = (now - startTime) / 1000;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Time passed: {secondsPassed.toFixed(3)}</h1>\n      <button onClick={handleStart}>\n        Start\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen the “Stop” button is pressed, you need to cancel the existing interval so that it stops updating the now state variable. You can do this by calling clearInterval, but you need to give it the interval ID that was previously returned by the setInterval call when the user pressed Start. You need to keep the interval ID somewhere. Since the interval ID is not used for rendering, you can keep it in a ref:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Stopwatch() {\n  const [startTime, setStartTime] = useState(null);\n  const [now, setNow] = useState(null);\n  const intervalRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleStart() {\n    setStartTime(Date.now());\n    setNow(Date.now());\n\n    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);\n    intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {\n      setNow(Date.now());\n    }, 10);\n  }\n\n  function handleStop() {\n    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);\n  }\n\n  let secondsPassed = 0;\n  if (startTime != null && now != null) {\n    secondsPassed = (now - startTime) / 1000;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Time passed: {secondsPassed.toFixed(3)}</h1>\n      <button onClick={handleStart}>\n        Start\n      </button>\n      <button onClick={handleStop}>\n        Stop\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen a piece of information is used for rendering, keep it in state. When a piece of information is only needed by event handlers and changing it doesn’t require a re-render, using a ref may be more efficient.\n\nDifferences between refs and state \n\nPerhaps you’re thinking refs seem less “strict” than state—you can mutate them instead of always having to use a state setting function, for instance. But in most cases, you’ll want to use state. Refs are an “escape hatch” you won’t need often. Here’s how state and refs compare:\n\nrefs\tstate\nuseRef(initialValue) returns { current: initialValue }\tuseState(initialValue) returns the current value of a state variable and a state setter function ( [value, setValue])\nDoesn’t trigger re-render when you change it.\tTriggers re-render when you change it.\nMutable—you can modify and update current’s value outside of the rendering process.\t“Immutable”—you must use the state setting function to modify state variables to queue a re-render.\nYou shouldn’t read (or write) the current value during rendering.\tYou can read state at any time. However, each render has its own snapshot of state which does not change.\n\nHere is a counter button that’s implemented with state:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      You clicked {count} times\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nBecause the count value is displayed, it makes sense to use a state value for it. When the counter’s value is set with setCount(), React re-renders the component and the screen updates to reflect the new count.\n\nIf you tried to implement this with a ref, React would never re-render the component, so you’d never see the count change! See how clicking this button does not update its text:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  let countRef = useRef(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    // This doesn't re-render the component!\n    countRef.current = countRef.current + 1;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      You clicked {countRef.current} times\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is why reading ref.current during render leads to unreliable code. If you need that, use state instead.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow does useRef work inside? \nShow Details\nWhen to use refs \n\nTypically, you will use a ref when your component needs to “step outside” React and communicate with external APIs—often a browser API that won’t impact the appearance of the component. Here are a few of these rare situations:\n\nStoring timeout IDs\nStoring and manipulating DOM elements, which we cover on the next page\nStoring other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.\n\nIf your component needs to store some value, but it doesn’t impact the rendering logic, choose refs.\n\nBest practices for refs \n\nFollowing these principles will make your components more predictable:\n\nTreat refs as an escape hatch. Refs are useful when you work with external systems or browser APIs. If much of your application logic and data flow relies on refs, you might want to rethink your approach.\nDon’t read or write ref.current during rendering. If some information is needed during rendering, use state instead. Since React doesn’t know when ref.current changes, even reading it while rendering makes your component’s behavior difficult to predict. (The only exception to this is code like if (!ref.current) ref.current = new Thing() which only sets the ref once during the first render.)\n\nLimitations of React state don’t apply to refs. For example, state acts like a snapshot for every render and doesn’t update synchronously. But when you mutate the current value of a ref, it changes immediately:\n\nref.current = 5;\n\nconsole.log(ref.current); // 5\n\nThis is because the ref itself is a regular JavaScript object, and so it behaves like one.\n\nYou also don’t need to worry about avoiding mutation when you work with a ref. As long as the object you’re mutating isn’t used for rendering, React doesn’t care what you do with the ref or its contents.\n\nRefs and the DOM \n\nYou can point a ref to any value. However, the most common use case for a ref is to access a DOM element. For example, this is handy if you want to focus an input programmatically. When you pass a ref to a ref attribute in JSX, like <div ref={myRef}>, React will put the corresponding DOM element into myRef.current. Once the element is removed from the DOM, React will update myRef.current to be null. You can read more about this in Manipulating the DOM with Refs.\n\nRecap\nRefs are an escape hatch to hold onto values that aren’t used for rendering. You won’t need them often.\nA ref is a plain JavaScript object with a single property called current, which you can read or set.\nYou can ask React to give you a ref by calling the useRef Hook.\nLike state, refs let you retain information between re-renders of a component.\nUnlike state, setting the ref’s current value does not trigger a re-render.\nDon’t read or write ref.current during rendering. This makes your component hard to predict.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Fix a broken chat input\n2. Fix a component failing to re-render\n3. Fix debouncing\n4.

During this delay, you can see an “Undo” button. Click it. This “Undo” button is supposed to stop the “Sent!” message from appearing.

There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node.

They let you “step outside” of React and synchronize your components with some external system. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component’s state when some props or state change), you shouldn’t need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.\n\nThere are two common cases in which you don’t need Effects:\n\nYou don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering.\nYou don’t need Effects to handle user events.\n\nFor example, you don’t need an Effect to adjust some state based on other state:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');\n\n\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect\n\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);\n\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nInstead, calculate as much as you can while rendering:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');\n\n  // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering\n\n  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nHowever, you do need Effects to synchronize with external systems.\n\nReady to learn this topic?\n\nRead You Might Not Need an Effect to learn how to remove unnecessary Effects.\n\nRead More\nLifecycle of reactive effects \n\nEffects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time.\n\nThis Effect depends on the value of the roomId prop. Props are reactive values, which means they can change on a re-render. Notice that the Effect re-synchronizes (and re-connects to the server) if roomId changes:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nReact provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly. If you forget to specify roomId in the list of dependencies in the above example, the linter will find that bug automatically.\n\nReady to learn this topic?\n\nRead Lifecycle of Reactive Events to learn how an Effect’s lifecycle is different from a component’s.\n\nRead More\nSeparating events from Effects \nUnder Construction\n\nThis section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.\n\nEvent handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if any of the values they read, like props or state, are different than during last render. Sometimes, you want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others.\n\nAll code inside Effects is reactive. It will run again if some reactive value it reads has changed due to a re-render. For example, this Effect will re-connect to the chat if either roomId or theme have changed:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nnotifications.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';\nimport { showNotification } from './notifications.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n      showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n    });\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId, theme]);\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={isDark}\n          onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}\n        />\n        Use dark theme\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom\n        roomId={roomId}\n        theme={isDark ?

This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. The way you remove them depends on the case.\n\nFor example, this Effect depends on the options object which gets re-created every time you edit the input:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  const options = {\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n    roomId: roomId\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [options]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou don’t want the chat to re-connect every time you start typing a message in that chat.

To change the dependency list, change the code.\n\nReady to learn this topic?\n\nRead Removing Effect Dependencies to learn how to make your Effect re-run less often.\n\nRead More\nReusing logic with custom Hooks \n\nReact comes with built-in Hooks like useState, useContext, and useEffect. Sometimes, you’ll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. To do this, you can create your own Hooks for your application’s needs.\n\nIn this example, the usePointerPosition custom Hook tracks the cursor position, while useDelayedValue custom Hook returns a value that’s “lagging behind” the value you passed by a certain number of milliseconds. Move the cursor over the sandbox preview area to see a moving trail of dots following the cursor:\n\nApp.js\nusePointerPosition.js\nuseDelayedValue.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { usePointerPosition } from './usePointerPosition.js';\nimport { useDelayedValue } from './useDelayedValue.js';\n\nexport default function Canvas() {\n  const pos1 = usePointerPosition();\n  const pos2 = useDelayedValue(pos1, 100);\n  const pos3 = useDelayedValue(pos2, 200);\n  const pos4 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 100);\n  const pos5 = useDelayedValue(pos4, 50);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Dot position={pos1} opacity={1} />\n      <Dot position={pos2} opacity={0.8} />\n      <Dot position={pos3} opacity={0.6} />\n      <Dot position={pos4} opacity={0.4} />\n      <Dot position={pos5} opacity={0.2} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Dot({ position, opacity }) {\n  return (\n    <div style={{\n      position: 'absolute',\n      backgroundColor: 'pink',\n      borderRadius: '50%',\n      opacity,\n      transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\n      pointerEvents: 'none',\n      left: -20,\n      top: -20,\n      width: 40,\n      height: 40,\n    }} />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can create custom Hooks, compose them together, pass data between them, and reuse them between components. As your app grows, you will write fewer Effects by hand because you’ll be able to reuse custom Hooks you already wrote. There are also many excellent custom Hooks maintained by the React community.\n\nReady to learn this topic?\n\nRead Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks to learn how to share logic between components.\n\nRead More\nWhat’s next? \n\nHead over to Referencing Values with Refs to start reading this chapter page by page!\n\nPREVIOUS\nScaling Up with Reducer and Context\nNEXT\nReferencing Values with Refs"

However, as your app grows, you might run into another difficulty. Currently, the tasks state and the dispatch function are only available in the top-level TaskApp component. To let other components read the list of tasks or change it, you have to explicitly pass down the current state and the event handlers that change it as props.\n\nFor example, TaskApp passes a list of tasks and the event handlers to TaskList:\n\n<TaskList\n\n  tasks={tasks}\n\n  onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}\n\n  onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}\n\n/>\n\nAnd TaskList passes the event handlers to Task:\n\n<Task\n\n  task={task}\n\n  onChange={onChangeTask}\n\n  onDelete={onDeleteTask}\n\n/>\n\nIn a small example like this, this works well, but if you have tens or hundreds of components in the middle, passing down all state and functions can be quite frustrating!\n\nThis is why, as an alternative to passing them through props, you might want to put both the tasks state and the dispatch function into context. This way, any component below TaskApp in the tree can read the tasks and dispatch actions without the repetitive “prop drilling”.\n\nHere is how you can combine a reducer with context:\n\nCreate the context.\nPut state and dispatch into context.\nUse context anywhere in the tree.\nStep 1: Create the context \n\nThe useReducer Hook returns the current tasks and the dispatch function that lets you update them:\n\nconst [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);\n\nTo pass them down the tree, you will create two separate contexts:\n\nTasksContext provides the current list of tasks.\nTasksDispatchContext provides the function that lets components dispatch actions.\n\nExport them from a separate file so that you can later import them from other files:\n\nApp.js\nTasksContext.js\nAddTask.js\nTaskList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\nexport const TasksContext = createContext(null);\nexport const TasksDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n\n\nHere, you’re passing null as the default value to both contexts. The actual values will be provided by the TaskApp component.\n\nStep 2: Put state and dispatch into context \n\nNow you can import both contexts in your TaskApp component. Take the tasks and dispatch returned by useReducer() and provide them to the entire tree below:\n\nimport { TasksContext, TasksDispatchContext } from './TasksContext.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function TaskApp() {\n\n  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>\n\n      <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n\n        ...\n\n      </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>\n\n    </TasksContext.Provider>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nFor now, you pass the information both via props and in context:\n\nApp.js\nTasksContext.js\nAddTask.js\nTaskList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\nimport AddTask from './AddTask.js';\nimport TaskList from './TaskList.js';\nimport { TasksContext, TasksDispatchContext } from './TasksContext.js';\n\nexport default function TaskApp() {\n  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(\n    tasksReducer,\n    initialTasks\n  );\n\n  function handleAddTask(text) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'added',\n      id: nextId++,\n      text: text,\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleChangeTask(task) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'changed',\n      task: task\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'deleted',\n      id: taskId\n    });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>\n      <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        <h1>Day off in Kyoto</h1>\n        <AddTask\n          onAddTask={handleAddTask}\n        />\n        <TaskList\n          tasks={tasks}\n          onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}\n          onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}\n        />\n      </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </TasksContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction tasksReducer(tasks, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'added': {\n      return [...tasks, {\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        done: false\n      }];\n    }\n    case 'changed': {\n      return tasks.map(t => {\n        if (t.id === action.task.id) {\n          return action.task;\n        } else {\n          return t;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n    case 'deleted': {\n      return tasks.filter(t => t.id !== action.id);\n    }\n    default: {\n      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialTasks = [\n  { id: 0, text: 'Philosopher’s Path', done: true },\n  { id: 1, text: 'Visit the temple', done: false },\n  { id: 2, text: 'Drink matcha', done: false }\n];\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn the next step, you will remove prop passing.\n\nStep 3: Use context anywhere in the tree \n\nNow you don’t need to pass the list of tasks or the event handlers down the tree:\n\n<TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>\n\n  <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n\n    <h1>Day off in Kyoto</h1>\n\n    <AddTask />\n\n    <TaskList />\n\n  </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>\n\n</TasksContext.Provider>\n\nInstead, any component that needs the task list can read it from the TaskContext:\n\nexport default function TaskList() {\n\n  const tasks = useContext(TasksContext);\n\n  // ...\n\nTo update the task list, any component can read the dispatch function from context and call it:\n\nexport default function AddTask() {\n\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  const dispatch = useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    // ...\n\n    <button onClick={() => {\n\n      setText('');\n\n      dispatch({\n\n        type: 'added',\n\n        id: nextId++,\n\n        text: text,\n\n      });\n\n    }}>Add</button>\n\n    // ...\n\nThe TaskApp component does not pass any event handlers down, and the TaskList does not pass any event handlers to the Task component either. Each component reads the context that it needs:\n\nApp.js\nTasksContext.js\nAddTask.js\nTaskList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useContext } from 'react';\nimport { TasksContext, TasksDispatchContext } from './TasksContext.js';\n\nexport default function TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useContext(TasksContext);\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {tasks.map(task => (\n        <li key={task.id}>\n          <Task task={task} />\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Task({ task }) {\n  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);\n  const dispatch = useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n  let taskContent;\n  if (isEditing) {\n    taskContent = (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={task.text}\n          onChange={e => {\n            dispatch({\n              type: 'changed',\n              task: {\n                ...task,\n                text: e.target.value\n              }\n            });\n          }} />\n        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(false)}>\n          Save\n        </button>\n      </>\n    );\n  } else {\n    taskContent = (\n      <>\n        {task.text}\n        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(true)}>\n          Edit\n        </button>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        checked={task.done}\n        onChange={e => {\n          dispatch({\n            type: 'changed',\n            task: {\n              ...task,\n              done: e.target.checked\n            }\n          });\n        }}\n      />\n      {taskContent}\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        dispatch({\n          type: 'deleted',\n          id: task.id\n        });\n      }}>\n        Delete\n      </button>\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe state still “lives” in the top-level TaskApp component, managed with useReducer. But its tasks and dispatch are now available to every component below in the tree by importing and using these contexts.\n\nMoving all wiring into a single file \n\nYou don’t have to do this, but you could further declutter the components by moving both reducer and context into a single file. Currently, TasksContext.js contains only two context declarations:\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport const TasksContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport const TasksDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\nThis file is about to get crowded! You’ll move the reducer into that same file. Then you’ll declare a new TasksProvider component in the same file. This component will tie all the pieces together:\n\nIt will manage the state with a reducer.\nIt will provide both contexts to components below.\nIt will take children as a prop so you can pass JSX to it.\nexport function TasksProvider({ children }) {\n\n  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>\n\n      <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n\n        {children}\n\n      </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>\n\n    </TasksContext.Provider>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis removes all the complexity and wiring from your TaskApp component:\n\nApp.js\nTasksContext.js\nAddTask.js\nTaskList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport AddTask from './AddTask.js';\nimport TaskList from './TaskList.js';\nimport { TasksProvider } from './TasksContext.js';\n\nexport default function TaskApp() {\n  return (\n    <TasksProvider>\n      <h1>Day off in Kyoto</h1>\n      <AddTask />\n      <TaskList />\n    </TasksProvider>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nYou can also export functions that use the context from TasksContext.js:\n\nexport function useTasks() {\n\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n\n}\n\n\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n\n}\n\nWhen a component needs to read context, it can do it through these functions:\n\nconst tasks = useTasks();\n\nconst dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n\nThis doesn’t change the behavior in any way, but it lets you later split these contexts further or add some logic to these functions. Now all of the context and reducer wiring is in TasksContext.js. This keeps the components clean and uncluttered, focused on what they display rather than where they get the data:\n\nApp.js\nTasksContext.js\nAddTask.js\nTaskList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useTasks, useTasksDispatch } from './TasksContext.js';\n\nexport default function TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTasks();\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {tasks.map(task => (\n        <li key={task.id}>\n          <Task task={task} />\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Task({ task }) {\n  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);\n  const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n  let taskContent;\n  if (isEditing) {\n    taskContent = (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={task.text}\n          onChange={e => {\n            dispatch({\n              type: 'changed',\n              task: {\n                ...task,\n                text: e.target.value\n              }\n            });\n          }} />\n        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(false)}>\n          Save\n        </button>\n      </>\n    );\n  } else {\n    taskContent = (\n      <>\n        {task.text}\n        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(true)}>\n          Edit\n        </button>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        checked={task.done}\n        onChange={e => {\n          dispatch({\n            type: 'changed',\n            task: {\n              ...task,\n              done: e.target.checked\n            }\n          });\n        }}\n      />\n      {taskContent}\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        dispatch({\n          type: 'deleted',\n          id: task.id\n        });\n      }}>\n        Delete\n      </button>\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can think of TasksProvider as a part of the screen that knows how to deal with tasks, useTasks as a way to read them, and useTasksDispatch as a way to update them from any component below in the tree.\n\nNote\n\nFunctions like useTasks and useTasksDispatch are called Custom Hooks.

The nearest common ancestor could be far removed from the components that need data, and lifting state up that high can lead to a situation called “prop drilling”.\n\nLifting state up\n\nProp drilling\n\nWouldn’t it be great if there were a way to “teleport” data to the components in the tree that need it without passing props? With React’s context feature, there is!\n\nContext: an alternative to passing props \n\nContext lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it. There are many uses for context. Here is one example. Consider this Heading component that accepts a level for its size:\n\nApp.js\nSection.js\nHeading.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Heading from './Heading.js';\nimport Section from './Section.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Section>\n      <Heading level={1}>Title</Heading>\n      <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading>\n      <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading>\n      <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n      <Heading level={5}>Sub-sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n      <Heading level={6}>Sub-sub-sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s say you want multiple headings within the same Section to always have the same size:\n\nApp.js\nSection.js\nHeading.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Heading from './Heading.js';\nimport Section from './Section.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Section>\n      <Heading level={1}>Title</Heading>\n      <Section>\n        <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading>\n        <Section>\n          <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Section>\n            <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n          </Section>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nCurrently, you pass the level prop to each <Heading> separately:\n\n<Section>\n\n  <Heading level={3}>About</Heading>\n\n  <Heading level={3}>Photos</Heading>\n\n  <Heading level={3}>Videos</Heading>\n\n</Section>\n\nIt would be nice if you could pass the level prop to the <Section> component instead and remove it from the <Heading>. This way you could enforce that all headings in the same section have the same size:\n\n<Section level={3}>\n\n  <Heading>About</Heading>\n\n  <Heading>Photos</Heading>\n\n  <Heading>Videos</Heading>\n\n</Section>\n\nBut how can the <Heading> component know the level of its closest <Section>? That would require some way for a child to “ask” for data from somewhere above in the tree.\n\nYou can’t do it with props alone. This is where context comes into play. You will do it in three steps:\n\nCreate a context. (You can call it LevelContext, since it’s for the heading level.)\nUse that context from the component that needs the data. (Heading will use LevelContext.)\nProvide that context from the component that specifies the data. (Section will provide LevelContext.)\n\nContext lets a parent—even a distant one!—provide some data to the entire tree inside of it.\n\nUsing context in close children\n\nUsing context in distant children\n\nStep 1: Create the context \n\nFirst, you need to create the context.

Here, 1 refers to the biggest heading level, but you could pass any kind of value (even an object). You will see the significance of the default value in the next step.\n\nStep 2: Use the context \n\nImport the useContext Hook from React and your context:\n\nimport { useContext } from 'react';\n\nimport { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';\n\nCurrently, the Heading component reads level from props:\n\nexport default function Heading({ level, children }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nInstead, remove the level prop and read the value from the context you just imported, LevelContext:\n\nexport default function Heading({ children }) {\n\n  const level = useContext(LevelContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nuseContext is a Hook. Just like useState and useReducer, you can only call a Hook immediately inside a React component (not inside loops or conditions). useContext tells React that the Heading component wants to read the LevelContext.\n\nNow that the Heading component doesn’t have a level prop, you don’t need to pass the level prop to Heading in your JSX like this anymore:\n\n<Section>\n\n  <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n\n  <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n\n  <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n\n</Section>\n\nUpdate the JSX so that it’s the Section that receives it instead:\n\n<Section level={4}>\n\n  <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n\n  <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n\n  <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n\n</Section>\n\nAs a reminder, this is the markup that you were trying to get working:\n\nApp.js\nSection.js\nHeading.js\nLevelContext.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Heading from './Heading.js';\nimport Section from './Section.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Section level={1}>\n      <Heading>Title</Heading>\n      <Section level={2}>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Section level={3}>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Section level={4}>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n          </Section>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice this example doesn’t quite work, yet! All the headings have the same size because even though you’re using the context, you have not provided it yet. React doesn’t know where to get it!\n\nIf you don’t provide the context, React will use the default value you’ve specified in the previous step. In this example, you specified 1 as the argument to createContext, so useContext(LevelContext) returns 1, setting all those headings to <h1>. Let’s fix this problem by having each Section provide its own context.\n\nStep 3: Provide the context \n\nThe Section component currently renders its children:\n\nexport default function Section({ children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <section className=\"section\">\n\n      {children}\n\n    </section>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWrap them with a context provider to provide the LevelContext to them:\n\nimport { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function Section({ level, children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <section className=\"section\">\n\n      <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>\n\n        {children}\n\n      </LevelContext.Provider>\n\n    </section>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis tells React: “if any component inside this <Section> asks for LevelContext, give them this level.” The component will use the value of the nearest <LevelContext.Provider> in the UI tree above it.\n\nApp.js\nSection.js\nHeading.js\nLevelContext.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Heading from './Heading.js';\nimport Section from './Section.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Section level={1}>\n      <Heading>Title</Heading>\n      <Section level={2}>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Section level={3}>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Section level={4}>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n          </Section>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIt’s the same result as the original code, but you did not need to pass the level prop to each Heading component! Instead, it “figures out” its heading level by asking the closest Section above:\n\nYou pass a level prop to the <Section>.\nSection wraps its children into <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>.\nHeading asks the closest value of LevelContext above with useContext(LevelContext).\nUsing and providing context from the same component \n\nCurrently, you still have to specify each section’s level manually:\n\nexport default function Page() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Section level={1}>\n\n      ...\n\n      <Section level={2}>\n\n        ...\n\n        <Section level={3}>\n\n          ...\n\nSince context lets you read information from a component above, each Section could read the level from the Section above, and pass level + 1 down automatically. Here is how you could do it:\n\nimport { useContext } from 'react';\n\nimport { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function Section({ children }) {\n\n  const level = useContext(LevelContext);\n\n  return (\n\n    <section className=\"section\">\n\n      <LevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}>\n\n        {children}\n\n      </LevelContext.Provider>\n\n    </section>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWith this change, you don’t need to pass the level prop either to the <Section> or to the <Heading>:\n\nApp.js\nSection.js\nHeading.js\nLevelContext.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Heading from './Heading.js';\nimport Section from './Section.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Section>\n      <Heading>Title</Heading>\n      <Section>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Heading>Heading</Heading>\n        <Section>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>\n          <Section>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>\n          </Section>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNow both Heading and Section read the LevelContext to figure out how “deep” they are. And the Section wraps its children into the LevelContext to specify that anything inside of it is at a “deeper” level.\n\nNote\n\nThis example uses heading levels because they show visually how nested components can override context. But context is useful for many other use cases too. You can pass down any information needed by the entire subtree: the current color theme, the currently logged in user, and so on.\n\nContext passes through intermediate components \n\nYou can insert as many components as you like between the component that provides context and the one that uses it. This includes both built-in components like <div> and components you might build yourself.\n\nIn this example, the same Post component (with a dashed border) is rendered at two different nesting levels. Notice that the <Heading> inside of it gets its level automatically from the closest <Section>:\n\nApp.js\nSection.js\nHeading.js\nLevelContext.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Heading from './Heading.js';\nimport Section from './Section.js';\n\nexport default function ProfilePage() {\n  return (\n    <Section>\n      <Heading>My Profile</Heading>\n      <Post\n        title=\"Hello traveller!\"\n        body=\"Read about my adventures.\"\n      />\n      <AllPosts />\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction AllPosts() {\n  return (\n    <Section>\n      <Heading>Posts</Heading>\n      <RecentPosts />\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction RecentPosts() {\n  return (\n    <Section>\n      <Heading>Recent Posts</Heading>\n      <Post\n        title=\"Flavors of Lisbon\"\n        body=\"...those pastéis de nata!\"\n      />\n      <Post\n        title=\"Buenos Aires in the rhythm of tango\"\n        body=\"I loved it!\"\n      />\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Post({ title, body }) {\n  return (\n    <Section isFancy={true}>\n      <Heading>\n        {title}\n      </Heading>\n      <p><i>{body}</i></p>\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou didn’t do anything special for this to work. A Section specifies the context for the tree inside it, so you can insert a <Heading> anywhere, and it will have the correct size. Try it in the sandbox above!\n\nContext lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings” and display themselves differently depending on where (or, in other words, in which context) they are being rendered.\n\nHow context works might remind you of CSS property inheritance. In CSS, you can specify color: blue for a <div>, and any DOM node inside of it, no matter how deep, will inherit that color unless some other DOM node in the middle overrides it with color: green. Similarly, in React, the only way to override some context coming from above is to wrap children into a context provider with a different value.\n\nIn CSS, different properties like color and background-color don’t override each other. You can set all  <div>’s color to red without impacting background-color. Similarly, different React contexts don’t override each other. Each context that you make with createContext() is completely separate from other ones, and ties together components using and providing that particular context. One component may use or provide many different contexts without a problem.\n\nBefore you use context \n\nContext is very tempting to use! However, this also means it’s too easy to overuse it. Just because you need to pass some props several levels deep doesn’t mean you should put that information into context.\n\nHere’s a few alternatives you should consider before using context:\n\nStart by passing props. If your components are not trivial, it’s not unusual to pass a dozen props down through a dozen components. It may feel like a slog, but it makes it very clear which components use which data! The person maintaining your code will be glad you’ve made the data flow explicit with props.\nExtract components and pass JSX as children to them. If you pass some data through many layers of intermediate components that don’t use that data (and only pass it further down), this often means that you forgot to extract some components along the way. For example, maybe you pass data props like posts to visual components that don’t use them directly, like <Layout posts={posts} />. Instead, make Layout take children as a prop, and render <Layout><Posts posts={posts} /></Layout>. This reduces the number of layers between the component specifying the data and the one that needs it.\n\nIf neither of these approaches works well for you, consider context.\n\nUse cases for context \nTheming: If your app lets the user change its appearance (e.g. dark mode), you can put a context provider at the top of your app, and use that context in components that need to adjust their visual look.\nCurrent account: Many components might need to know the currently logged in user. Putting it in context makes it convenient to read it anywhere in the tree. Some apps also let you operate multiple accounts at the same time (e.g. to leave a comment as a different user). In those cases, it can be convenient to wrap a part of the UI into a nested provider with a different current account value.\nRouting: Most routing solutions use context internally to hold the current route. This is how every link “knows” whether it’s active or not. If you build your own router, you might want to do it too.\nManaging state: As your app grows, you might end up with a lot of state closer to the top of your app. Many distant components below may want to change it. It is common to use a reducer together with context to manage complex state and pass it down to distant components without too much hassle.\n\nContext is not limited to static values. If you pass a different value on the next render, React will update all the components reading it below! This is why context is often used in combination with state.\n\nIn general, if some information is needed by distant components in different parts of the tree, it’s a good indication that context will help you.\n\nRecap\nContext lets a component provide some information to the entire tree below it.\nTo pass context:\nCreate and export it with export const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue).\nPass it to the useContext(MyContext) Hook to read it in any child component, no matter how deep.\nWrap children into <MyContext.Provider value={...}> to provide it from a parent.\nContext passes through any components in the middle.\nContext lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings”.\nBefore you use context, try passing props or passing JSX as children.\nTry out some challenges\nChallenge 1 of 1: Replace prop drilling with context \n\nIn this example, toggling the checkbox changes the imageSize prop passed to each <PlaceImage>. The checkbox state is held in the top-level App component, but each <PlaceImage> needs to be aware of it.\n\nCurrently, App passes imageSize to List, which passes it to each Place, which passes it to the PlaceImage. Remove the imageSize prop, and instead pass it from the App component directly to PlaceImage.\n\nYou can declare context in Context.js.\n\nApp.js\nContext.js\ndata.js\nutils.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { places } from './data.js';\nimport { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isLarge, setIsLarge] = useState(false);\n  const imageSize = isLarge ? 150 : 100;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={isLarge}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setIsLarge(e.target.checked);\n          }}\n        />\n        Use large images\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <List imageSize={imageSize} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction List({ imageSize }) {\n  const listItems = places.map(place =>\n    <li key={place.id}>\n      <Place\n        place={place}\n        imageSize={imageSize}\n      />\n    </li>\n  );\n  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;\n}\n\nfunction Place({ place, imageSize }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <PlaceImage\n        place={place}\n        imageSize={imageSize}\n      />\n      <p>\n        <b>{place.name}</b>\n        {': ' + place.description}\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PlaceImage({ place, imageSize }) {\n  return (\n    <img\n      src={getImageUrl(place)}\n      alt={place.name}\n      width={imageSize}\n      height={imageSize}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nShow solution\nPREVIOUS\nExtracting State Logic into a Reducer\nNEXT\nScaling Up with Reducer and Context"

But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it’s holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.\n\nHere, there is only one <Counter /> JSX tag, but it’s rendered at two different positions:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const counter = <Counter />;\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {counter}\n      {counter}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\n  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\n\n  let className = 'counter';\n  if (hover) {\n    className += ' hover';\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={className}\n      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}\n    >\n      <h1>{score}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>\n        Add one\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere’s how these look as a tree:\n\nReact tree\n\nThese are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. You don’t usually have to think about these positions to use React, but it can be useful to understand how it works.\n\nIn React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state. For example, if you render two Counter components side by side, each of them will get its own, independent, score and hover states.\n\nTry clicking both counters and notice they don’t affect each other:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Counter />\n      <Counter />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\n  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\n\n  let className = 'counter';\n  if (hover) {\n    className += ' hover';\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={className}\n      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}\n    >\n      <h1>{score}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>\n        Add one\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nAs you can see, when one counter is updated, only the state for that component is updated:\n\nUpdating state\n\nReact will keep the state around for as long as you render the same component at the same position in the tree.

That’s because when React removes a component, it destroys its state.\n\nDeleting a component\n\nWhen you tick “Render the second counter”, a second Counter and its state are initialized from scratch (score = 0) and added to the DOM.\n\nAdding a component\n\nReact preserves a component’s state for as long as it’s being rendered at its position in the UI tree. If it gets removed, or a different component gets rendered at the same position, React discards its state.\n\nSame component at the same position preserves state \n\nIn this example, there are two different <Counter /> tags:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isFancy ?

This is because both of these <Counter /> tags are rendered at the same position. React doesn’t know where you place the conditions in your function. All it “sees” is the tree you return.\n\nIn both cases, the App component returns a <div> with <Counter /> as a first child. To React, these two counters have the same “address”: the first child of the first child of the root. This is how React matches them up between the previous and next renders, regardless of how you structure your logic.\n\nDifferent components at the same position reset state \n\nIn this example, ticking the checkbox will replace <Counter> with a <p>:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isPaused ? (\n        <p>See you later!</p> \n      ) : (\n        <Counter /> \n      )}\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={isPaused}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setIsPaused(e.target.checked)\n          }}\n        />\n        Take a break\n      </label>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\n  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\n\n  let className = 'counter';\n  if (hover) {\n    className += ' hover';\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={className}\n      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}\n    >\n      <h1>{score}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>\n        Add one\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere, you switch between different component types at the same position. Initially, the first child of the <div> contained a Counter. But when you swapped in a p, React removed the Counter from the UI tree and destroyed its state.\n\nWhen Counter changes to p, the Counter is deleted and the p is added\n\nWhen switching back, the p is deleted and the Counter is added\n\nAlso, when you render a different component in the same position, it resets the state of its entire subtree. To see how this works, increment the counter and then tick the checkbox:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isFancy ? (\n        <div>\n          <Counter isFancy={true} /> \n        </div>\n      ) : (\n        <section>\n          <Counter isFancy={false} />\n        </section>\n      )}\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={isFancy}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setIsFancy(e.target.checked)\n          }}\n        />\n        Use fancy styling\n      </label>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Counter({ isFancy }) {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\n  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\n\n  let className = 'counter';\n  if (hover) {\n    className += ' hover';\n  }\n  if (isFancy) {\n    className += ' fancy';\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={className}\n      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}\n    >\n      <h1>{score}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>\n        Add one\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe counter state gets reset when you click the checkbox. Although you render a Counter, the first child of the div changes from a div to a section. When the child div was removed from the DOM, the whole tree below it (including the Counter and its state) was destroyed as well.\n\nWhen section changes to div, the section is deleted and the new div is added\n\nWhen switching back, the div is deleted and the new section is added\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree needs to “match up” from one render to another. If the structure is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree.\n\nPitfall\n\nThis is why you should not nest component function definitions.\n\nHere, the MyTextField component function is defined inside MyComponent:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n\n  function MyTextField() {\n    const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n    return (\n      <input\n        value={text}\n        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <MyTextField />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setCounter(counter + 1)\n      }}>Clicked {counter} times</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nEvery time you click the button, the input state disappears! This is because a different MyTextField function is created for every render of MyComponent. You’re rendering a different component in the same position, so React resets all state below. This leads to bugs and performance problems. To avoid this problem, always declare component functions at the top level, and don’t nest their definitions.\n\nResetting state at the same position \n\nBy default, React preserves state of a component while it stays at the same position. Usually, this is exactly what you want, so it makes sense as the default behavior. But sometimes, you may want to reset a component’s state. Consider this app that lets two players keep track of their scores during each turn:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Scoreboard() {\n  const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isPlayerA ? (\n        <Counter person=\"Taylor\" />\n      ) : (\n        <Counter person=\"Sarah\" />\n      )}\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setIsPlayerA(!isPlayerA);\n      }}>\n        Next player!\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Counter({ person }) {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\n  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\n\n  let className = 'counter';\n  if (hover) {\n    className += ' hover';\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={className}\n      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}\n    >\n      <h1>{person}'s score: {score}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>\n        Add one\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nCurrently, when you change the player, the score is preserved. The two Counters appear in the same position, so React sees them as the same Counter whose person prop has changed.\n\nBut conceptually, in this app they should be two separate counters. They might appear in the same place in the UI, but one is a counter for Taylor, and another is a counter for Sarah.\n\nThere are two ways to reset state when switching between them:\n\nRender components in different positions\nGive each component an explicit identity with key\nOption 1: Rendering a component in different positions \n\nIf you want these two Counters to be independent, you can render them in two different positions:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Scoreboard() {\n  const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isPlayerA &&\n        <Counter person=\"Taylor\" />\n      }\n      {!isPlayerA &&\n        <Counter person=\"Sarah\" />\n      }\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setIsPlayerA(!isPlayerA);\n      }}>\n        Next player!\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Counter({ person }) {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\n  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\n\n  let className = 'counter';\n  if (hover) {\n    className += ' hover';\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={className}\n      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}\n    >\n      <h1>{person}'s score: {score}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>\n        Add one\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nInitially, isPlayerA is true. So the first position contains Counter state, and the second one is empty.\nWhen you click the “Next player” button the first position clears but the second one now contains a Counter.\n\nInitial state\n\nClicking “next”\n\nClicking “next” again\n\nEach Counter’s state gets destroyed each time it’s removed from the DOM. This is why they reset every time you click the button.\n\nThis solution is convenient when you only have a few independent components rendered in the same place. In this example, you only have two, so it’s not a hassle to render both separately in the JSX.\n\nOption 2: Resetting state with a key \n\nThere is also another, more generic, way to reset a component’s state.\n\nYou might have seen keys when rendering lists. Keys aren’t just for lists! You can use keys to make React distinguish between any components. By default, React uses order within the parent (“first counter”, “second counter”) to discern between components. But keys let you tell React that this is not just a first counter, or a second counter, but a specific counter—for example, Taylor’s counter. This way, React will know Taylor’s counter wherever it appears in the tree!\n\nIn this example, the two <Counter />s don’t share state even though they appear in the same place in JSX:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Scoreboard() {\n  const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isPlayerA ? (\n        <Counter key=\"Taylor\" person=\"Taylor\" />\n      ) : (\n        <Counter key=\"Sarah\" person=\"Sarah\" />\n      )}\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setIsPlayerA(!isPlayerA);\n      }}>\n        Next player!\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Counter({ person }) {\n  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);\n  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);\n\n  let className = 'counter';\n  if (hover) {\n    className += ' hover';\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={className}\n      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}\n    >\n      <h1>{person}'s score: {score}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>\n        Add one\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nSwitching between Taylor and Sarah does not preserve the state. This is because you gave them different keys:\n\n{isPlayerA ? (\n\n  <Counter key=\"Taylor\" person=\"Taylor\" />\n\n) : (\n\n  <Counter key=\"Sarah\" person=\"Sarah\" />\n\n)}\n\nSpecifying a key tells React to use the key itself as part of the position, instead of their order within the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state. Every time a counter appears on the screen, its state is created. Every time it is removed, its state is destroyed. Toggling between them resets their state over and over.\n\nNote\n\nRemember that keys are not globally unique. They only specify the position within the parent.\n\nResetting a form with a key \n\nResetting state with a key is particularly useful when dealing with forms.\n\nIn this chat app, the <Chat> component contains the text input state:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport Chat from './Chat.js';\nimport ContactList from './ContactList.js';\n\nexport default function Messenger() {\n  const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ContactList\n        contacts={contacts}\n        selectedContact={to}\n        onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)}\n      />\n      <Chat contact={to} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nconst contacts = [\n  { id: 0, name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@mail.com' },\n  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@mail.com' },\n  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@mail.com' }\n];\n\n\nShow more\n\nTry entering something into the input, and then press “Alice” or “Bob” to choose a different recipient. You will notice that the input state is preserved because the <Chat> is rendered at the same position in the tree.\n\nIn many apps, this may be the desired behavior, but not in a chat app! You don’t want to let the user send a message they already typed to a wrong person due to an accidental click. To fix it, add a key:\n\n<Chat key={to.id} contact={to} />\n\nThis ensures that when you select a different recipient, the Chat component will be recreated from scratch, including any state in the tree below it. React will also re-create the DOM elements instead of reusing them.\n\nNow switching the recipient always clears the text field:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport Chat from './Chat.js';\nimport ContactList from './ContactList.js';\n\nexport default function Messenger() {\n  const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ContactList\n        contacts={contacts}\n        selectedContact={to}\n        onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)}\n      />\n      <Chat key={to.id} contact={to} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nconst contacts = [\n  { id: 0, name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@mail.com' },\n  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@mail.com' },\n  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@mail.com' }\n];\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nPreserving state for removed components \nShow Details\nRecap\nReact keeps state for as long as the same component is rendered at the same position.\nState is not kept in JSX tags.

    "html": "MANAGING STATE\nExtracting State Logic into a Reducer\n\nComponents with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called a reducer.\n\nYou will learn\nWhat a reducer function is\nHow to refactor useState to useReducer\nWhen to use a reducer\nHow to write one well\nConsolidate state logic with a reducer \n\nAs your components grow in complexity, it can get harder to see at a glance all the different ways in which a component’s state gets updated. For example, the TaskApp component below holds an array of tasks in state and uses three different event handlers to add, remove, and edit tasks:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport AddTask from './AddTask.js';\nimport TaskList from './TaskList.js';\n\nexport default function TaskApp() {\n  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);\n\n  function handleAddTask(text) {\n    setTasks([\n      ...tasks,\n      {\n        id: nextId++,\n        text: text,\n        done: false,\n      },\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  function handleChangeTask(task) {\n    setTasks(\n      tasks.map((t) => {\n        if (t.id === task.id) {\n          return task;\n        } else {\n          return t;\n        }\n      })\n    );\n  }\n\n  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n    setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== taskId));\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>\n      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />\n      <TaskList\n        tasks={tasks}\n        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}\n        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialTasks = [\n  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},\n  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},\n  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},\n];\n\n\nShow more\n\nEach of its event handlers calls setTasks in order to update the state. As this component grows, so does the amount of state logic sprinkled throughout it. To reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place, you can move that state logic into a single function outside your component, called a “reducer”.\n\nReducers are a different way to handle state. You can migrate from useState to useReducer in three steps:\n\nMove from setting state to dispatching actions.\nWrite a reducer function.\nUse the reducer from your component.\nStep 1: Move from setting state to dispatching actions \n\nYour event handlers currently specify what to do by setting state:\n\nfunction handleAddTask(text) {\n\n  setTasks([\n\n    ...tasks,\n\n    {\n\n      id: nextId++,\n\n      text: text,\n\n      done: false,\n\n    },\n\n  ]);\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction handleChangeTask(task) {\n\n  setTasks(\n\n    tasks.map((t) => {\n\n      if (t.id === task.id) {\n\n        return task;\n\n      } else {\n\n        return t;\n\n      }\n\n    })\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n\n  setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== taskId));\n\n}\n\nRemove all the state setting logic. What you are left with are three event handlers:\n\nhandleAddTask(text) is called when the user presses “Add”.\nhandleChangeTask(task) is called when the user toggles a task or presses “Save”.\nhandleDeleteTask(taskId) is called when the user presses “Delete”.\n\nManaging state with reducers is slightly different from directly setting state. Instead of telling React “what to do” by setting state, you specify “what the user just did” by dispatching “actions” from your event handlers. (The state update logic will live elsewhere!) So instead of “setting tasks” via an event handler, you’re dispatching an “added/changed/deleted a task” action. This is more descriptive of the user’s intent.\n\nfunction handleAddTask(text) {\n\n  dispatch({\n\n    type: 'added',\n\n    id: nextId++,\n\n    text: text,\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction handleChangeTask(task) {\n\n  dispatch({\n\n    type: 'changed',\n\n    task: task,\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n\n  dispatch({\n\n    type: 'deleted',\n\n    id: taskId,\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nThe object you pass to dispatch is called an “action”:\n\nfunction handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n\n  dispatch(\n\n    // \"action\" object:\n\n    {\n\n      type: 'deleted',\n\n      id: taskId,\n\n    }\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIt is a regular JavaScript object. You decide what to put in it, but generally it should contain the minimal information about what happened. (You will add the dispatch function itself in a later step.)\n\nNote\n\nAn action object can have any shape.\n\nBy convention, it is common to give it a string type that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields. The type is specific to a component, so in this example either 'added' or 'added_task' would be fine. Choose a name that says what happened!\n\ndispatch({\n\n  // specific to component\n\n  type: 'what_happened',\n\n  // other fields go here\n\n});\nStep 2: Write a reducer function \n\nA reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the next state:\n\nfunction yourReducer(state, action) {\n\n  // return next state for React to set\n\n}\n\nReact will set the state to what you return from the reducer.\n\nTo move your state setting logic from your event handlers to a reducer function in this example, you will:\n\nDeclare the current state (tasks) as the first argument.\nDeclare the action object as the second argument.\nReturn the next state from the reducer (which React will set the state to).\n\nHere is all the state setting logic migrated to a reducer function:\n\nfunction tasksReducer(tasks, action) {\n\n  if (action.type === 'added') {\n\n    return [\n\n      ...tasks,\n\n      {\n\n        id: action.id,\n\n        text: action.text,\n\n        done: false,\n\n      },\n\n    ];\n\n  } else if (action.type === 'changed') {\n\n    return tasks.map((t) => {\n\n      if (t.id === action.task.id) {\n\n        return action.task;\n\n      } else {\n\n        return t;\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n  } else if (action.type === 'deleted') {\n\n    return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);\n\n  } else {\n\n    throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nBecause the reducer function takes state (tasks) as an argument, you can declare it outside of your component. This decreases the indentation level and can make your code easier to read.\n\nNote\n\nThe code above uses if/else statements, but it’s a convention to use switch statements inside reducers. The result is the same, but it can be easier to read switch statements at a glance.\n\nWe’ll be using them throughout the rest of this documentation like so:\n\nfunction tasksReducer(tasks, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'added': {\n\n      return [\n\n        ...tasks,\n\n        {\n\n          id: action.id,\n\n          text: action.text,\n\n          done: false,\n\n        },\n\n      ];\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed': {\n\n      return tasks.map((t) => {\n\n        if (t.id === action.task.id) {\n\n          return action.task;\n\n        } else {\n\n          return t;\n\n        }\n\n      });\n\n    }\n\n    case 'deleted': {\n\n      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);\n\n    }\n\n    default: {\n\n      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nWe recommend wrapping each case block into the { and } curly braces so that variables declared inside of different cases don’t clash with each other. Also, a case should usually end with a return. If you forget to return, the code will “fall through” to the next case, which can lead to mistakes!\n\nIf you’re not yet comfortable with switch statements, using if/else is completely fine.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy are reducers called this way? \nShow Details\nStep 3: Use the reducer from your component \n\nFinally, you need to hook up the tasksReducer to your component. Import the useReducer Hook from React:\n\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\nThen you can replace useState:\n\nconst [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);\n\nwith useReducer like so:\n\nconst [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);\n\nThe useReducer Hook is similar to useState—you must pass it an initial state and it returns a stateful value and a way to set state (in this case, the dispatch function). But it’s a little different.\n\nThe useReducer Hook takes two arguments:\n\nA reducer function\nAn initial state\n\nAnd it returns:\n\nA stateful value\nA dispatch function (to “dispatch” user actions to the reducer)\n\nNow it’s fully wired up! Here, the reducer is declared at the bottom of the component file:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\nimport AddTask from './AddTask.js';\nimport TaskList from './TaskList.js';\n\nexport default function TaskApp() {\n  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);\n\n  function handleAddTask(text) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'added',\n      id: nextId++,\n      text: text,\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleChangeTask(task) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'changed',\n      task: task,\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'deleted',\n      id: taskId,\n    });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>\n      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />\n      <TaskList\n        tasks={tasks}\n        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}\n        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction tasksReducer(tasks, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'added': {\n      return [\n        ...tasks,\n        {\n          id: action.id,\n          text: action.text,\n          done: false,\n        },\n      ];\n    }\n    case 'changed': {\n      return tasks.map((t) => {\n        if (t.id === action.task.id) {\n          return action.task;\n        } else {\n          return t;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n    case 'deleted': {\n      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);\n    }\n    default: {\n      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialTasks = [\n  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},\n  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},\n  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},\n];\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you want, you can even move the reducer to a different file:\n\nApp.js\ntasksReducer.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\nimport AddTask from './AddTask.js';\nimport TaskList from './TaskList.js';\nimport tasksReducer from './tasksReducer.js';\n\nexport default function TaskApp() {\n  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);\n\n  function handleAddTask(text) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'added',\n      id: nextId++,\n      text: text,\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleChangeTask(task) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'changed',\n      task: task,\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'deleted',\n      id: taskId,\n    });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>\n      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />\n      <TaskList\n        tasks={tasks}\n        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}\n        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialTasks = [\n  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},\n  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},\n  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},\n];\n\n\nShow more\n\nComponent logic can be easier to read when you separate concerns like this. Now the event handlers only specify what happened by dispatching actions, and the reducer function determines how the state updates in response to them.\n\nComparing useState and useReducer \n\nReducers are not without downsides! Here’s a few ways you can compare them:\n\nCode size: Generally, with useState you have to write less code upfront. With useReducer, you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions. However, useReducer can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.\nReadability: useState is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component’s code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, useReducer lets you cleanly separate the how of update logic from the what happened of event handlers.\nDebugging: When you have a bug with useState, it can be difficult to tell where the state was set incorrectly, and why. With useReducer, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and why it happened (due to which action). If each action is correct, you’ll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with useState.\nTesting: A reducer is a pure function that doesn’t depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it’s best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.\nPersonal preference: Some people like reducers, others don’t. That’s okay. It’s a matter of preference. You can always convert between useState and useReducer back and forth: they are equivalent!\n\nWe recommend using a reducer if you often encounter bugs due to incorrect state updates in some component, and want to introduce more structure to its code. You don’t have to use reducers for everything: feel free to mix and match! You can even useState and useReducer in the same component.\n\nWriting reducers well \n\nKeep these two tips in mind when writing reducers:\n\nReducers must be pure. Similar to state updater functions, reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers must be pure—same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update objects and arrays without mutations.\nEach action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data. For example, if a user presses “Reset” on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one reset_form action rather than five separate set_field actions. If you log every action in a reducer, that log should be clear enough for you to reconstruct what interactions or responses happened in what order. This helps with debugging!\nWriting concise reducers with Immer \n\nJust like with updating objects and arrays in regular state, you can use the Immer library to make reducers more concise. Here, useImmerReducer lets you mutate the state with push or arr[i] = assignment:\n\nApp.js\npackage.json\nReset\nFork\nimport { useImmerReducer } from 'use-immer';\nimport AddTask from './AddTask.js';\nimport TaskList from './TaskList.js';\n\nfunction tasksReducer(draft, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'added': {\n      draft.push({\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        done: false,\n      });\n      break;\n    }\n    case 'changed': {\n      const index = draft.findIndex((t) => t.id === action.task.id);\n      draft[index] = action.task;\n      break;\n    }\n    case 'deleted': {\n      return draft.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);\n    }\n    default: {\n      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function TaskApp() {\n  const [tasks, dispatch] = useImmerReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);\n\n  function handleAddTask(text) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'added',\n      id: nextId++,\n      text: text,\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleChangeTask(task) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'changed',\n      task: task,\n    });\n  }\n\n  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'deleted',\n      id: taskId,\n    });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>\n      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />\n      <TaskList\n        tasks={tasks}\n        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}\n        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialTasks = [\n  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},\n  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},\n  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},\n];\n\n\nShow more\n\nReducers must be pure, so they shouldn’t mutate state. But Immer provides you with a special draft object which is safe to mutate. Under the hood, Immer will create a copy of your state with the changes you made to the draft. This is why reducers managed by useImmerReducer can mutate their first argument and don’t need to return state.\n\nRecap\nTo convert from useState to useReducer:\nDispatch actions from event handlers.\nWrite a reducer function that returns the next state for a given state and action.\nReplace useState with useReducer.\nReducers require you to write a bit more code, but they help with debugging and testing.\nReducers must be pure.\nEach action describes a single user interaction.\nUse Immer if you want to write reducers in a mutating style.\nTry out some challenges\n1.

    "html": "MANAGING STATE\nSharing State Between Components\n\nSometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as lifting state up, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to share state between components by lifting it up\nWhat are controlled and uncontrolled components\nLifting state up by example \n\nIn this example, a parent Accordion component renders two separate Panels:\n\nAccordion\nPanel\nPanel\n\nEach Panel component has a boolean isActive state that determines whether its content is visible.\n\nPress the Show button for both panels:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <section className=\"panel\">\n      <h3>{title}</h3>\n      {isActive ? (\n        <p>{children}</p>\n      ) : (\n        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>\n          Show\n        </button>\n      )}\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default function Accordion() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>\n      <Panel title=\"About\">\n        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.\n      </Panel>\n      <Panel title=\"Etymology\">\n        The name comes from <span lang=\"kk-KZ\">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for \"apple\" and is often translated as \"full of apples\". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang=\"la\">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.\n      </Panel>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how pressing one panel’s button does not affect the other panel—they are independent.\n\nInitially, each Panel’s isActive state is false, so they both appear collapsed\n\nClicking either Panel’s button will only update that Panel’s isActive state alone\n\nBut now let’s say you want to change it so that only one panel is expanded at any given time. With that design, expanding the second panel should collapse the first one. How would you do that?\n\nTo coordinate these two panels, you need to “lift their state up” to a parent component in three steps:\n\nRemove state from the child components.\nPass hardcoded data from the common parent.\nAdd state to the common parent and pass it down together with the event handlers.\n\nThis will allow the Accordion component to coordinate both Panels and only expand one at a time.\n\nStep 1: Remove state from the child components \n\nYou will give control of the Panel’s isActive to its parent component. This means that the parent component will pass isActive to Panel as a prop instead. Start by removing this line from the Panel component:\n\nconst [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);\n\nAnd instead, add isActive to the Panel’s list of props:\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {\n\nNow the Panel’s parent component can control isActive by passing it down as a prop. Conversely, the Panel component now has no control over the value of isActive—it’s now up to the parent component!\n\nStep 2: Pass hardcoded data from the common parent \n\nTo lift state up, you must locate the closest common parent component of both of the child components that you want to coordinate:\n\nAccordion (closest common parent)\nPanel\nPanel\n\nIn this example, it’s the Accordion component. Since it’s above both panels and can control their props, it will become the “source of truth” for which panel is currently active. Make the Accordion component pass a hardcoded value of isActive (for example, true) to both panels:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Accordion() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>\n      <Panel title=\"About\" isActive={true}>\n        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.\n      </Panel>\n      <Panel title=\"Etymology\" isActive={true}>\n        The name comes from <span lang=\"kk-KZ\">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for \"apple\" and is often translated as \"full of apples\". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang=\"la\">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.\n      </Panel>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"panel\">\n      <h3>{title}</h3>\n      {isActive ? (\n        <p>{children}</p>\n      ) : (\n        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>\n          Show\n        </button>\n      )}\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTry editing the hardcoded isActive values in the Accordion component and see the result on the screen.\n\nStep 3: Add state to the common parent \n\nLifting state up often changes the nature of what you’re storing as state.\n\nIn this case, only one panel should be active at a time. This means that the Accordion common parent component needs to keep track of which panel is the active one. Instead of a boolean value, it could use a number as the index of the active Panel for the state variable:\n\nconst [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);\n\nWhen the activeIndex is 0, the first panel is active, and when it’s 1, it’s the second one.\n\nClicking the “Show” button in either Panel needs to change the active index in Accordion. A Panel can’t set the activeIndex state directly because it’s defined inside the Accordion. The Accordion component needs to explicitly allow the Panel component to change its state by passing an event handler down as a prop:\n\n<>\n\n  <Panel\n\n    isActive={activeIndex === 0}\n\n    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}\n\n  >\n\n    ...\n\n  </Panel>\n\n  <Panel\n\n    isActive={activeIndex === 1}\n\n    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}\n\n  >\n\n    ...\n\n  </Panel>\n\n</>\n\nThe <button> inside the Panel will now use the onShow prop as its click event handler:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Accordion() {\n  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>\n      <Panel\n        title=\"About\"\n        isActive={activeIndex === 0}\n        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}\n      >\n        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.\n      </Panel>\n      <Panel\n        title=\"Etymology\"\n        isActive={activeIndex === 1}\n        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}\n      >\n        The name comes from <span lang=\"kk-KZ\">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for \"apple\" and is often translated as \"full of apples\". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang=\"la\">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.\n      </Panel>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({\n  title,\n  children,\n  isActive,\n  onShow\n}) {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"panel\">\n      <h3>{title}</h3>\n      {isActive ? (\n        <p>{children}</p>\n      ) : (\n        <button onClick={onShow}>\n          Show\n        </button>\n      )}\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis completes lifting state up! Moving state into the common parent component allowed you to coordinate the two panels. Using the active index instead of two “is shown” flags ensured that only one panel is active at a given time. And passing down the event handler to the child allowed the child to change the parent’s state.\n\nInitially, Accordion’s activeIndex is 0, so the first Panel receives isActive = true\n\nWhen Accordion’s activeIndex state changes to 1, the second Panel receives isActive = true instead\n\nDEEP DIVE\nControlled and uncontrolled components \nShow Details\nA single source of truth for each state \n\nIn a React application, many components will have their own state. Some state may “live” close to the leaf components (components at the bottom of the tree) like inputs. Other state may “live” closer to the top of the app. For example, even client-side routing libraries are usually implemented by storing the current route in the React state, and passing it down by props!\n\nFor each unique piece of state, you will choose the component that “owns” it. This principle is also known as having a “single source of truth”. It doesn’t mean that all state lives in one place—but that for each piece of state, there is a specific component that holds that piece of information. Instead of duplicating shared state between components, lift it up to their common shared parent, and pass it down to the children that need it.\n\nYour app will change as you work on it. It is common that you will move state down or back up while you’re still figuring out where each piece of the state “lives”. This is all part of the process!\n\nTo see what this feels like in practice with a few more components, read Thinking in React.\n\nRecap\nWhen you want to coordinate two components, move their state to their common parent.\nThen pass the information down through props from their common parent.\nFinally, pass the event handlers down so that the children can change the parent’s state.\nIt’s useful to consider components as “controlled” (driven by props) or “uncontrolled” (driven by state).\nTry out some challenges\n1.

    "html": "MANAGING STATE\nChoosing the State Structure\n\nStructuring state well can make a difference between a component that is pleasant to modify and debug, and one that is a constant source of bugs. Here are some tips you should consider when structuring state.\n\nYou will learn\nWhen to use a single vs multiple state variables\nWhat to avoid when organizing state\nHow to fix common issues with the state structure\nPrinciples for structuring state \n\nWhen you write a component that holds some state, you’ll have to make choices about how many state variables to use and what the shape of their data should be. While it’s possible to write correct programs even with a suboptimal state structure, there are a few principles that can guide you to make better choices:\n\nGroup related state. If you always update two or more state variables at the same time, consider merging them into a single state variable.\nAvoid contradictions in state. When the state is structured in a way that several pieces of state may contradict and “disagree” with each other, you leave room for mistakes. Try to avoid this.\nAvoid redundant state. If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state.\nAvoid duplication in state. When the same data is duplicated between multiple state variables, or within nested objects, it is difficult to keep them in sync. Reduce duplication when you can.\nAvoid deeply nested state. Deeply hierarchical state is not very convenient to update. When possible, prefer to structure state in a flat way.\n\nThe goal behind these principles is to make state easy to update without introducing mistakes. Removing redundant and duplicate data from state helps ensure that all its pieces stay in sync. This is similar to how a database engineer might want to “normalize” the database structure to reduce the chance of bugs. To paraphrase Albert Einstein, “Make your state as simple as it can be—but no simpler.”\n\nNow let’s see how these principles apply in action.\n\nGroup related state \n\nYou might sometimes be unsure between using a single or multiple state variables.\n\nShould you do this?\n\nconst [x, setX] = useState(0);\n\nconst [y, setY] = useState(0);\n\nOr this?\n\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n\nTechnically, you can use either of these approaches. But if some two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable. Then you won’t forget to always keep them in sync, like in this example where moving the cursor updates both coordinates of the red dot:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MovingDot() {\n  const [position, setPosition] = useState({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0\n  });\n  return (\n    <div\n      onPointerMove={e => {\n        setPosition({\n          x: e.clientX,\n          y: e.clientY\n        });\n      }}\n      style={{\n        position: 'relative',\n        width: '100vw',\n        height: '100vh',\n      }}>\n      <div style={{\n        position: 'absolute',\n        backgroundColor: 'red',\n        borderRadius: '50%',\n        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\n        left: -10,\n        top: -10,\n        width: 20,\n        height: 20,\n      }} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nAnother case where you’ll group data into an object or an array is when you don’t know how many pieces of state you’ll need. For example, it’s helpful when you have a form where the user can add custom fields.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf your state variable is an object, remember that you can’t update only one field in it without explicitly copying the other fields. For example, you can’t do setPosition({ x: 100 }) in the above example because it would not have the y property at all! Instead, if you wanted to set x alone, you would either do setPosition({ ...position, x: 100 }), or split them into two state variables and do setX(100).\n\nAvoid contradictions in state \n\nHere is a hotel feedback form with isSending and isSent state variables:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function FeedbackForm() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false);\n  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);\n\n  async function handleSubmit(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setIsSending(true);\n    await sendMessage(text);\n    setIsSending(false);\n    setIsSent(true);\n  }\n\n  if (isSent) {\n    return <h1>Thanks for feedback!</h1>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <p>How was your stay at The Prancing Pony?</p>\n      <textarea\n        disabled={isSending}\n        value={text}\n        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <br />\n      <button\n        disabled={isSending}\n        type=\"submit\"\n      >\n        Send\n      </button>\n      {isSending && <p>Sending...</p>}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n// Pretend to send a message.\nfunction sendMessage(text) {\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    setTimeout(resolve, 2000);\n  });\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhile this code works, it leaves the door open for “impossible” states. For example, if you forget to call setIsSent and setIsSending together, you may end up in a situation where both isSending and isSent are true at the same time. The more complex your component is, the harder it is to understand what happened.\n\nSince isSending and isSent should never be true at the same time, it is better to replace them with one status state variable that may take one of three valid states: 'typing' (initial), 'sending', and 'sent':\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function FeedbackForm() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');\n\n  async function handleSubmit(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setStatus('sending');\n    await sendMessage(text);\n    setStatus('sent');\n  }\n\n  const isSending = status === 'sending';\n  const isSent = status === 'sent';\n\n  if (isSent) {\n    return <h1>Thanks for feedback!</h1>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <p>How was your stay at The Prancing Pony?</p>\n      <textarea\n        disabled={isSending}\n        value={text}\n        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <br />\n      <button\n        disabled={isSending}\n        type=\"submit\"\n      >\n        Send\n      </button>\n      {isSending && <p>Sending...</p>}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n// Pretend to send a message.\nfunction sendMessage(text) {\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    setTimeout(resolve, 2000);\n  });\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can still declare some constants for readability:\n\nconst isSending = status === 'sending';\n\nconst isSent = status === 'sent';\n\nBut they’re not state variables, so you don’t need to worry about them getting out of sync with each other.\n\nAvoid redundant state \n\nIf you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state.\n\nFor example, take this form. It works, but can you find any redundant state in it?\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n    setFullName(e.target.value + ' ' + lastName);\n  }\n\n  function handleLastNameChange(e) {\n    setLastName(e.target.value);\n    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Let’s check you in</h2>\n      <label>\n        First name:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={firstName}\n          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={lastName}\n          onChange={handleLastNameChange}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <p>\n        Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b>\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis form has three state variables: firstName, lastName, and fullName. However, fullName is redundant.

Instead, it’s calculated during render:\n\nconst fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n\nAs a result, the change handlers don’t need to do anything special to update it.

However, this is not great: the contents of the selectedItem is the same object as one of the items inside the items list. This means that the information about the item itself is duplicated in two places.\n\nWhy is this a problem? Let’s make each item editable:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst initialItems = [\n  { title: 'pretzels', id: 0 },\n  { title: 'crispy seaweed', id: 1 },\n  { title: 'granola bar', id: 2 },\n];\n\nexport default function Menu() {\n  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems);\n  const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState(\n    items[0]\n  );\n\n  function handleItemChange(id, e) {\n    setItems(items.map(item => {\n      if (item.id === id) {\n        return {\n          ...item,\n          title: e.target.value,\n        };\n      } else {\n        return item;\n      }\n    }));\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>What's your travel snack?</h2> \n      <ul>\n        {items.map((item, index) => (\n          <li key={item.id}>\n            <input\n              value={item.title}\n              onChange={e => {\n                handleItemChange(item.id, e)\n              }}\n            />\n            {' '}\n            <button onClick={() => {\n              setSelectedItem(item);\n            }}>Choose</button>\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n      <p>You picked {selectedItem.title}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how if you first click “Choose” on an item and then edit it, the input updates but the label at the bottom does not reflect the edits. This is because you have duplicated state, and you forgot to update selectedItem.\n\nAlthough you could update selectedItem too, an easier fix is to remove duplication. In this example, instead of a selectedItem object (which creates a duplication with objects inside items), you hold the selectedId in state, and then get the selectedItem by searching the items array for an item with that ID:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst initialItems = [\n  { title: 'pretzels', id: 0 },\n  { title: 'crispy seaweed', id: 1 },\n  { title: 'granola bar', id: 2 },\n];\n\nexport default function Menu() {\n  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems);\n  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(0);\n\n  const selectedItem = items.find(item =>\n    item.id === selectedId\n  );\n\n  function handleItemChange(id, e) {\n    setItems(items.map(item => {\n      if (item.id === id) {\n        return {\n          ...item,\n          title: e.target.value,\n        };\n      } else {\n        return item;\n      }\n    }));\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>What's your travel snack?</h2>\n      <ul>\n        {items.map((item, index) => (\n          <li key={item.id}>\n            <input\n              value={item.title}\n              onChange={e => {\n                handleItemChange(item.id, e)\n              }}\n            />\n            {' '}\n            <button onClick={() => {\n              setSelectedId(item.id);\n            }}>Choose</button>\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n      <p>You picked {selectedItem.title}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\n(Alternatively, you may hold the selected index in state.)\n\nThe state used to be duplicated like this:\n\nitems = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...]\nselectedItem = {id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}\n\nBut after the change it’s like this:\n\nitems = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...]\nselectedId = 0\n\nThe duplication is gone, and you only keep the essential state!\n\nNow if you edit the selected item, the message below will update immediately. This is because setItems triggers a re-render, and items.find(...) would find the item with the updated title. You didn’t need to hold the selected item in state, because only the selected ID is essential. The rest could be calculated during render.\n\nAvoid deeply nested state \n\nImagine a travel plan consisting of planets, continents, and countries.

How would you go about it? Updating nested state involves making copies of objects all the way up from the part that changed. Deleting a deeply nested place would involve copying its entire parent place chain. Such code can be very verbose.\n\nIf the state is too nested to update easily, consider making it “flat”. Here is one way you can restructure this data. Instead of a tree-like structure where each place has an array of its child places, you can have each place hold an array of its child place IDs. Then store a mapping from each place ID to the corresponding place.\n\nThis data restructuring might remind you of seeing a database table:\n\nplaces.js\nReset\nFork\nexport const initialTravelPlan =

    "html": "MANAGING STATE\nReacting to Input with State\n\nReact provides a declarative way to manipulate the UI. Instead of manipulating individual pieces of the UI directly, you describe the different states that your component can be in, and switch between them in response to the user input. This is similar to how designers think about the UI.\n\nYou will learn\nHow declarative UI programming differs from imperative UI programming\nHow to enumerate the different visual states your component can be in\nHow to trigger the changes between the different visual states from code\nHow declarative UI compares to imperative \n\nWhen you design UI interactions, you probably think about how the UI changes in response to user actions. Consider a form that lets the user submit an answer:\n\nWhen you type something into the form, the “Submit” button becomes enabled.\nWhen you press “Submit”, both the form and the button become disabled, and a spinner appears.\nIf the network request succeeds, the form gets hidden, and the “Thank you” message appears.\nIf the network request fails, an error message appears, and the form becomes enabled again.\n\nIn imperative programming, the above corresponds directly to how you implement interaction. You have to write the exact instructions to manipulate the UI depending on what just happened. Here’s another way to think about this: imagine riding next to someone in a car and telling them turn by turn where to go.\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nThey don’t know where you want to go, they just follow your commands. (And if you get the directions wrong, you end up in the wrong place!) It’s called imperative because you have to “command” each element, from the spinner to the button, telling the computer how to update the UI.\n\nIn this example of imperative UI programming, the form is built without React. It only uses the browser DOM:\n\nindex.js\nindex.html\nReset\nFork\nasync function handleFormSubmit(e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  disable(textarea);\n  disable(button);\n  show(loadingMessage);\n  hide(errorMessage);\n  try {\n    await submitForm(textarea.value);\n    show(successMessage);\n    hide(form);\n  } catch (err) {\n    show(errorMessage);\n    errorMessage.textContent = err.message;\n  } finally {\n    hide(loadingMessage);\n    enable(textarea);\n    enable(button);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction handleTextareaChange() {\n  if (textarea.value.length === 0) {\n    disable(button);\n  } else {\n    enable(button);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction hide(el) {\n  el.style.display = 'none';\n}\n\nfunction show(el) {\n  el.style.display = '';\n}\n\nfunction enable(el) {\n  el.disabled = false;\n}\n\nfunction disable(el) {\n  el.disabled = true;\n}\n\nfunction submitForm(answer) {\n  // Pretend it's hitting the network.\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      if (answer.toLowerCase() === 'istanbul') {\n        resolve();\n      } else {\n        reject(new Error('Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!'));\n      }\n    }, 1500);\n  });\n}\n\nlet form = document.getElementById('form');\nlet textarea = document.getElementById('textarea');\nlet button = document.getElementById('button');\nlet loadingMessage = document.getElementById('loading');\nlet errorMessage = document.getElementById('error');\nlet successMessage = document.getElementById('success');\nform.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit;\ntextarea.oninput = handleTextareaChange;\n\n\nShow more\n\nManipulating the UI imperatively works well enough for isolated examples, but it gets exponentially more difficult to manage in more complex systems. Imagine updating a page full of different forms like this one. Adding a new UI element or a new interaction would require carefully checking all existing code to make sure you haven’t introduced a bug (for example, forgetting to show or hide something).\n\nReact was built to solve this problem.\n\nIn React, you don’t directly manipulate the UI—meaning you don’t enable, disable, show, or hide components directly. Instead, you declare what you want to show, and React figures out how to update the UI. Think of getting into a taxi and telling the driver where you want to go instead of telling them exactly where to turn. It’s the driver’s job to get you there, and they might even know some shortcuts you haven’t considered!\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nThinking about UI declaratively \n\nYou’ve seen how to implement a form imperatively above. To better understand how to think in React, you’ll walk through reimplementing this UI in React below:\n\nIdentify your component’s different visual states\nDetermine what triggers those state changes\nRepresent the state in memory using useState\nRemove any non-essential state variables\nConnect the event handlers to set the state\nStep 1: Identify your component’s different visual states \n\nIn computer science, you may hear about a “state machine” being in one of several “states”. If you work with a designer, you may have seen mockups for different “visual states”. React stands at the intersection of design and computer science, so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration.\n\nFirst, you need to visualize all the different “states” of the UI the user might see:\n\nEmpty: Form has a disabled “Submit” button.\nTyping: Form has an enabled “Submit” button.\nSubmitting: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.\nSuccess: “Thank you” message is shown instead of a form.\nError: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.\n\nJust like a designer, you’ll want to “mock up” or create “mocks” for the different states before you add logic. For example, here is a mock for just the visual part of the form. This mock is controlled by a prop called status with a default value of 'empty':\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Form({\n  status = 'empty'\n}) {\n  if (status === 'success') {\n    return <h1>That's right!</h1>\n  }\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>City quiz</h2>\n      <p>\n        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?\n      </p>\n      <form>\n        <textarea />\n        <br />\n        <button>\n          Submit\n        </button>\n      </form>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou could call that prop anything you like, the naming is not important. Try editing status = 'empty' to status = 'success' to see the success message appear. Mocking lets you quickly iterate on the UI before you wire up any logic. Here is a more fleshed out prototype of the same component, still “controlled” by the status prop:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Form({\n  // Try 'submitting', 'error', 'success':\n  status = 'empty'\n}) {\n  if (status === 'success') {\n    return <h1>That's right!</h1>\n  }\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>City quiz</h2>\n      <p>\n        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?\n      </p>\n      <form>\n        <textarea disabled={\n          status === 'submitting'\n        } />\n        <br />\n        <button disabled={\n          status === 'empty' ||\n          status === 'submitting'\n        }>\n          Submit\n        </button>\n        {status === 'error' &&\n          <p className=\"Error\">\n            Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!\n          </p>\n        }\n      </form>\n      </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nDisplaying many visual states at once \nShow Details\nStep 2: Determine what triggers those state changes \n\nYou can trigger state updates in response to two kinds of inputs:\n\nHuman inputs, like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link.\nComputer inputs, like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading.\nHuman inputs\nComputer inputs\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nIn both cases, you must set state variables to update the UI. For the form you’re developing, you will need to change state in response to a few different inputs:\n\nChanging the text input (human) should switch it from the Empty state to the Typing state or back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not.\nClicking the Submit button (human) should switch it to the Submitting state.\nSuccessful network response (computer) should switch it to the Success state.\nFailed network response (computer) should switch it to the Error state with the matching error message.\nNote\n\nNotice that human inputs often require event handlers!\n\nTo help visualize this flow, try drawing each state on paper as a labeled circle, and each change between two states as an arrow. You can sketch out many flows this way and sort out bugs long before implementation.\n\nForm states\n\nStep 3: Represent the state in memory with useState \n\nNext you’ll need to represent the visual states of your component in memory with useState. Simplicity is key: each piece of state is a “moving piece”, and you want as few “moving pieces” as possible. More complexity leads to more bugs!\n\nStart with the state that absolutely must be there. For example, you’ll need to store the answer for the input, and the error (if it exists) to store the last error:\n\nconst [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');\n\nconst [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\nThen, you’ll need a state variable representing which one of the visual states that you want to display. There’s usually more than a single way to represent that in memory, so you’ll need to experiment with it.\n\nIf you struggle to think of the best way immediately, start by adding enough state that you’re definitely sure that all the possible visual states are covered:\n\nconst [isEmpty, setIsEmpty] = useState(true);\n\nconst [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);\n\nconst [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);\n\nconst [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);\n\nconst [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);\n\nYour first idea likely won’t be the best, but that’s ok—refactoring state is a part of the process!\n\nStep 4: Remove any non-essential state variables \n\nYou want to avoid duplication in the state content so you’re only tracking what is essential. Spending a little time on refactoring your state structure will make your components easier to understand, reduce duplication, and avoid unintended meanings. Your goal is to prevent the cases where the state in memory doesn’t represent any valid UI that you’d want a user to see. (For example, you never want to show an error message and disable the input at the same time, or the user won’t be able to correct the error!)\n\nHere are some questions you can ask about your state variables:\n\nDoes this state cause a paradox? For example, isTyping and isSubmitting can’t both be true. A paradox usually means that the state is not constrained enough. There are four possible combinations of two booleans, but only three correspond to valid states. To remove the “impossible” state, you can combine these into a status that must be one of three values: 'typing', 'submitting', or 'success'.\nIs the same information available in another state variable already? Another paradox: isEmpty and isTyping can’t be true at the same time. By making them separate state variables, you risk them going out of sync and causing bugs. Fortunately, you can remove isEmpty and instead check answer.length === 0.\nCan you get the same information from the inverse of another state variable? isError is not needed because you can check error !== null instead.\n\nAfter this clean-up, you’re left with 3 (down from 7!) essential state variables:\n\nconst [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');\n\nconst [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\nconst [status, setStatus] = useState('typing'); // 'typing', 'submitting', or 'success'\n\nYou know they are essential, because you can’t remove any of them without breaking the functionality.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nEliminating “impossible” states with a reducer \nShow Details\nStep 5: Connect the event handlers to set state \n\nLastly, create event handlers that update the state. Below is the final form, with all event handlers wired up:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');\n\n  if (status === 'success') {\n    return <h1>That's right!</h1>\n  }\n\n  async function handleSubmit(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setStatus('submitting');\n    try {\n      await submitForm(answer);\n      setStatus('success');\n    } catch (err) {\n      setStatus('typing');\n      setError(err);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function handleTextareaChange(e) {\n    setAnswer(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>City quiz</h2>\n      <p>\n        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?\n      </p>\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n        <textarea\n          value={answer}\n          onChange={handleTextareaChange}\n          disabled={status === 'submitting'}\n        />\n        <br />\n        <button disabled={\n          answer.length === 0 ||\n          status === 'submitting'\n        }>\n          Submit\n        </button>\n        {error !== null &&\n          <p className=\"Error\">\n            {error.message}\n          </p>\n        }\n      </form>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction submitForm(answer) {\n  // Pretend it's hitting the network.\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== 'lima'\n      if (shouldError) {\n        reject(new Error('Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!'));\n      } else {\n        resolve();\n      }\n    }, 1500);\n  });\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nAlthough this code is longer than the original imperative example, it is much less fragile. Expressing all interactions as state changes lets you later introduce new visual states without breaking existing ones. It also lets you change what should be displayed in each state without changing the logic of the interaction itself.\n\nRecap\nDeclarative programming means describing the UI for each visual state rather than micromanaging the UI (imperative).\nWhen developing a component:\nIdentify all its visual states.\nDetermine the human and computer triggers for state changes.\nModel the state with useState.\nRemove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes.\nConnect the event handlers to set state.\nTry out some challenges\n1.

If there’s unnecessary state, it’s easy to forget to update it, and introduce bugs!\n\nFor example, this form has a redundant fullName state variable:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n    setFullName(e.target.value + ' ' + lastName);\n  }\n\n  function handleLastNameChange(e) {\n    setLastName(e.target.value);\n    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Let’s check you in</h2>\n      <label>\n        First name:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={firstName}\n          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={lastName}\n          onChange={handleLastNameChange}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <p>\n        Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b>\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can remove it and simplify the code by calculating fullName while the component is rendering:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n\n  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n\n  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  function handleLastNameChange(e) {\n    setLastName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Let’s check you in</h2>\n      <label>\n        First name:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={firstName}\n          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={lastName}\n          onChange={handleLastNameChange}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <p>\n        Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b>\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis might seem like a small change, but many bugs in React apps are fixed this way.\n\nReady to learn this topic?\n\nRead Choosing the State Structure to learn how to design the state shape to avoid bugs.\n\nRead More\nSharing state between components \n\nSometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as “lifting state up”, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.\n\nIn this example, only one panel should be active at a time. To achieve this, instead of keeping the active state inside each individual panel, the parent component holds the state and specifies the props for its children.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Accordion() {\n  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>\n      <Panel\n        title=\"About\"\n        isActive={activeIndex === 0}\n        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}\n      >\n        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city.

In most cases, React’s automatic behavior works well enough. By default, React preserves the parts of the tree that “match up” with the previously rendered component tree.\n\nHowever, sometimes this is not what you want. In this chat app, typing a message and then switching the recipient does not reset the input. This can make the user accidentally send a message to the wrong person:\n\nApp.js\nContactList.js\nChat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport Chat from './Chat.js';\nimport ContactList from './ContactList.js';\n\nexport default function Messenger() {\n  const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ContactList\n        contacts={contacts}\n        selectedContact={to}\n        onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)}\n      />\n      <Chat contact={to} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nconst contacts = [\n  { name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@mail.com' },\n  { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@mail.com' },\n  { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@mail.com' }\n];\n\n\nShow more\n\nReact lets you override the default behavior, and force a component to reset its state by passing it a different key, like <Chat key={email} />. This tells React that if the recipient is different, it should be considered a different Chat component that needs to be re-created from scratch with the new data (and UI like inputs). Now switching between the recipients resets the input field—even though you render the same component.\n\nApp.js\nContactList.js\nChat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport Chat from './Chat.js';\nimport ContactList from './ContactList.js';\n\nexport default function Messenger() {\n  const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ContactList\n        contacts={contacts}\n        selectedContact={to}\n        onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)}\n      />\n      <Chat key={to.email} contact={to} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nconst contacts = [\n  { name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@mail.com' },\n  { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@mail.com' },\n  { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@mail.com' }\n];\n\n\nShow more\nReady to learn this topic?\n\nRead Preserving and Resetting State to learn the lifetime of state and how to control it.\n\nRead More\nExtracting state logic into a reducer \n\nComponents with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called “reducer”.

But passing props can become inconvenient if you need to pass some prop through many components, or if many components need the same information. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep it is—without passing it explicitly through props.\n\nHere, the Heading component determines its heading level by “asking” the closest Section for its level. Each Section tracks its own level by asking the parent Section and adding one to it.

    "html": "ADDING INTERACTIVITY\nUpdating Arrays in State\n\nArrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to add, remove, or change items in an array in React state\nHow to update an object inside of an array\nHow to make array copying less repetitive with Immer\nUpdating arrays without mutation \n\nIn JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. Like with objects, you should treat arrays in React state as read-only. This means that you shouldn’t reassign items inside an array like arr[0] = 'bird', and you also shouldn’t use methods that mutate the array, such as push() and pop().\n\nInstead, every time you want to update an array, you’ll want to pass a new array to your state setting function. To do that, you can create a new array from the original array in your state by calling its non-mutating methods like filter() and map(). Then you can set your state to the resulting new array.\n\nHere is a reference table of common array operations. When dealing with arrays inside React state, you will need to avoid the methods in the left column, and instead prefer the methods in the right column:\n\n\tavoid (mutates the array)\tprefer (returns a new array)\nadding\tpush, unshift\tconcat, [...arr] spread syntax (example)\nremoving\tpop, shift, splice\tfilter, slice (example)\nreplacing\tsplice, arr[i] = ... assignment\tmap (example)\nsorting\treverse, sort\tcopy the array first (example)\n\nAlternatively, you can use Immer which lets you use methods from both columns.\n\nPitfall\n\nUnfortunately, slice and splice are named similarly but are very different:\n\nslice lets you copy an array or a part of it.\nsplice mutates the array (to insert or delete items).\n\nIn React, you will be using slice (no p!) a lot more often because you don’t want to mutate objects or arrays in state. Updating Objects explains what mutation is and why it’s not recommended for state.\n\nAdding to an array \n\npush() will mutate an array, which you don’t want:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet nextId = 0;\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        artists.push({\n          id: nextId++,\n          name: name,\n        });\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {artists.map(artist => (\n          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nInstead, create a new array which contains the existing items and a new item at the end. There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest one is to use the ... array spread syntax:\n\nsetArtists( // Replace the state\n\n  [ // with a new array\n\n    ...artists, // that contains all the old items\n\n    { id: nextId++, name: name } // and one new item at the end\n\n  ]\n\n);\n\nNow it works correctly:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet nextId = 0;\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setArtists([\n          ...artists,\n          { id: nextId++, name: name }\n        ]);\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {artists.map(artist => (\n          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe array spread syntax also lets you prepend an item by placing it before the original ...artists:\n\nsetArtists([\n\n  { id: nextId++, name: name },\n\n  ...artists // Put old items at the end\n\n]);\n\nIn this way, spread can do the job of both push() by adding to the end of an array and unshift() by adding to the beginning of an array. Try it in the sandbox above!\n\nRemoving from an array \n\nThe easiest way to remove an item from an array is to filter it out. In other words, you will produce a new array that will not contain that item. To do this, use the filter method, for example:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet initialArtists = [\n  { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' },\n  { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'},\n  { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'},\n];\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const [artists, setArtists] = useState(\n    initialArtists\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>\n      <ul>\n        {artists.map(artist => (\n          <li key={artist.id}>\n            {artist.name}{' '}\n            <button onClick={() => {\n              setArtists(\n                artists.filter(a =>\n                  a.id !== artist.id\n                )\n              );\n            }}>\n              Delete\n            </button>\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nClick the “Delete” button a few times, and look at its click handler.\n\nsetArtists(\n\n  artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)\n\n);\n\nHere, artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id) means “create an array that consists of those artists whose IDs are different from artist.id”. In other words, each artist’s “Delete” button will filter that artist out of the array, and then request a re-render with the resulting array. Note that filter does not modify the original array.\n\nTransforming an array \n\nIf you want to change some or all items of the array, you can use map() to create a new array. The function you will pass to map can decide what to do with each item, based on its data or its index (or both).\n\nIn this example, an array holds coordinates of two circles and a square. When you press the button, it moves only the circles down by 50 pixels. It does this by producing a new array of data using map():\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet initialShapes = [\n  { id: 0, type: 'circle', x: 50, y: 100 },\n  { id: 1, type: 'square', x: 150, y: 100 },\n  { id: 2, type: 'circle', x: 250, y: 100 },\n];\n\nexport default function ShapeEditor() {\n  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState(\n    initialShapes\n  );\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    const nextShapes = shapes.map(shape => {\n      if (shape.type === 'square') {\n        // No change\n        return shape;\n      } else {\n        // Return a new circle 50px below\n        return {\n          ...shape,\n          y: shape.y + 50,\n        };\n      }\n    });\n    // Re-render with the new array\n    setShapes(nextShapes);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Move circles down!\n      </button>\n      {shapes.map(shape => (\n        <div\n          key={shape.id}\n          style={{\n          background: 'purple',\n          position: 'absolute',\n          left: shape.x,\n          top: shape.y,\n          borderRadius:\n            shape.type === 'circle'\n              ? '50%' : '',\n          width: 20,\n          height: 20,\n        }} />\n      ))}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nReplacing items in an array \n\nIt is particularly common to want to replace one or more items in an array. Assignments like arr[0] = 'bird' are mutating the original array, so instead you’ll want to use map for this as well.\n\nTo replace an item, create a new array with map. Inside your map call, you will receive the item index as the second argument.

To do this, you can use the ... array spread syntax together with the slice() method. The slice() method lets you cut a “slice” of the array. To insert an item, you will create an array that spreads the slice before the insertion point, then the new item, and then the rest of the original array.\n\nIn this example, the Insert button always inserts at the index 1:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialArtists = [\n  { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' },\n  { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'},\n  { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'},\n];\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [artists, setArtists] = useState(\n    initialArtists\n  );\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    const insertAt = 1; // Could be any index\n    const nextArtists = [\n      // Items before the insertion point:\n      ...artists.slice(0, insertAt),\n      // New item:\n      { id: nextId++, name: name },\n      // Items after the insertion point:\n      ...artists.slice(insertAt)\n    ];\n    setArtists(nextArtists);\n    setName('');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Insert\n      </button>\n      <ul>\n        {artists.map(artist => (\n          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nMaking other changes to an array \n\nThere are some things you can’t do with the spread syntax and non-mutating methods like map() and filter() alone. For example, you may want to reverse or sort an array. The JavaScript reverse() and sort() methods are mutating the original array, so you can’t use them directly.\n\nHowever, you can copy the array first, and then make changes to it.\n\nFor example:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialList = [\n  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies' },\n  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape' },\n  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army' },\n];\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const [list, setList] = useState(initialList);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    const nextList = [...list];\n    nextList.reverse();\n    setList(nextList);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Reverse\n      </button>\n      <ul>\n        {list.map(artwork => (\n          <li key={artwork.id}>{artwork.title}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere, you use the [...list] spread syntax to create a copy of the original array first. Now that you have a copy, you can use mutating methods like nextList.reverse() or nextList.sort(), or even assign individual items with nextList[0] = \"something\".\n\nHowever, even if you copy an array, you can’t mutate existing items inside of it directly. This is because copying is shallow—the new array will contain the same items as the original one. So if you modify an object inside the copied array, you are mutating the existing state. For example, code like this is a problem.\n\nconst nextList = [...list];\n\nnextList[0].seen = true; // Problem: mutates list[0]\n\nsetList(nextList);\n\nAlthough nextList and list are two different arrays, nextList[0] and list[0] point to the same object. So by changing nextList[0].seen, you are also changing list[0].seen. This is a state mutation, which you should avoid! You can solve this issue in a similar way to updating nested JavaScript objects—by copying individual items you want to change instead of mutating them. Here’s how.\n\nUpdating objects inside arrays \n\nObjects are not really located “inside” arrays. They might appear to be “inside” in code, but each object in an array is a separate value, to which the array “points”. This is why you need to be careful when changing nested fields like list[0]. Another person’s artwork list may point to the same element of the array!\n\nWhen updating nested state, you need to create copies from the point where you want to update, and all the way up to the top level. Let’s see how this works.\n\nIn this example, two separate artwork lists have the same initial state. They are supposed to be isolated, but because of a mutation, their state is accidentally shared, and checking a box in one list affects the other list:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet nextId = 3;\nconst initialList = [\n  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies', seen: false },\n  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape', seen: false },\n  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army', seen: true },\n];\n\nexport default function BucketList() {\n  const [myList, setMyList] = useState(initialList);\n  const [yourList, setYourList] = useState(\n    initialList\n  );\n\n  function handleToggleMyList(artworkId, nextSeen) {\n    const myNextList = [...myList];\n    const artwork = myNextList.find(\n      a => a.id === artworkId\n    );\n    artwork.seen = nextSeen;\n    setMyList(myNextList);\n  }\n\n  function handleToggleYourList(artworkId, nextSeen) {\n    const yourNextList = [...yourList];\n    const artwork = yourNextList.find(\n      a => a.id === artworkId\n    );\n    artwork.seen = nextSeen;\n    setYourList(yourNextList);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Art Bucket List</h1>\n      <h2>My list of art to see:</h2>\n      <ItemList\n        artworks={myList}\n        onToggle={handleToggleMyList} />\n      <h2>Your list of art to see:</h2>\n      <ItemList\n        artworks={yourList}\n        onToggle={handleToggleYourList} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ItemList({ artworks, onToggle }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {artworks.map(artwork => (\n        <li key={artwork.id}>\n          <label>\n            <input\n              type=\"checkbox\"\n              checked={artwork.seen}\n              onChange={e => {\n                onToggle(\n                  artwork.id,\n                  e.target.checked\n                );\n              }}\n            />\n            {artwork.title}\n          </label>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe problem is in code like this:\n\nconst myNextList = [...myList];\n\nconst artwork = myNextList.find(a => a.id === artworkId);\n\nartwork.seen = nextSeen; // Problem: mutates an existing item\n\nsetMyList(myNextList);\n\nAlthough the myNextList array itself is new, the items themselves are the same as in the original myList array. So changing artwork.seen changes the original artwork item. That artwork item is also in yourList, which causes the bug.

    "html": "ADDING INTERACTIVITY\nUpdating Objects in State\n\nState can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn’t change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to correctly update an object in React state\nHow to update a nested object without mutating it\nWhat immutability is, and how not to break it\nHow to make object copying less repetitive with Immer\nWhat’s a mutation? \n\nYou can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.\n\nconst [x, setX] = useState(0);\n\nSo far you’ve been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are “immutable”, meaning unchangeable or “read-only”. You can trigger a re-render to replace a value:\n\nsetX(5);\n\nThe x state changed from 0 to 5, but the number 0 itself did not change. It’s not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.\n\nNow consider an object in state:\n\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n\nTechnically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a mutation:\n\nposition.x = 5;\n\nHowever, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them as if they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.\n\nTreat state as read-only \n\nIn other words, you should treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.\n\nThis example holds an object in state to represent the current pointer position. The red dot is supposed to move when you touch or move the cursor over the preview area. But the dot stays in the initial position:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nexport default function MovingDot() {\n  const [position, setPosition] = useState({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0\n  });\n  return (\n    <div\n      onPointerMove={e => {\n        position.x = e.clientX;\n        position.y = e.clientY;\n      }}\n      style={{\n        position: 'relative',\n        width: '100vw',\n        height: '100vh',\n      }}>\n      <div style={{\n        position: 'absolute',\n        backgroundColor: 'red',\n        borderRadius: '50%',\n        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\n        left: -10,\n        top: -10,\n        width: 20,\n        height: 20,\n      }} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe problem is with this bit of code.\n\nonPointerMove={e => {\n\n  position.x = e.clientX;\n\n  position.y = e.clientY;\n\n}}\n\nThis code modifies the object assigned to position from the previous render. But without using the state setting function, React has no idea that object has changed. So React does not do anything in response. It’s like trying to change the order after you’ve already eaten the meal. While mutating state can work in some cases, we don’t recommend it. You should treat the state value you have access to in a render as read-only.\n\nTo actually trigger a re-render in this case, create a new object and pass it to the state setting function:\n\nonPointerMove={e => {\n\n  setPosition({\n\n    x: e.clientX,\n\n    y: e.clientY\n\n  });\n\n}}\n\nWith setPosition, you’re telling React:\n\nReplace position with this new object\nAnd render this component again\n\nNotice how the red dot now follows your pointer when you touch or hover over the preview area:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nexport default function MovingDot() {\n  const [position, setPosition] = useState({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0\n  });\n  return (\n    <div\n      onPointerMove={e => {\n        setPosition({\n          x: e.clientX,\n          y: e.clientY\n        });\n      }}\n      style={{\n        position: 'relative',\n        width: '100vw',\n        height: '100vh',\n      }}>\n      <div style={{\n        position: 'absolute',\n        backgroundColor: 'red',\n        borderRadius: '50%',\n        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,\n        left: -10,\n        top: -10,\n        width: 20,\n        height: 20,\n      }} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nLocal mutation is fine \nShow Details\nCopying objects with the spread syntax \n\nIn the previous example, the position object is always created fresh from the current cursor position.

In React, it works a little differently from this mental model. On the previous page, you saw that setting state requests a re-render from React. This means that for an interface to react to the event, you need to update the state.\n\nIn this example, when you press “send”, setIsSent(true) tells React to re-render the UI:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hi!');\n  if (isSent) {\n    return <h1>Your message is on its way!</h1>\n  }\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={(e) => {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      setIsSent(true);\n      sendMessage(message);\n    }}>\n      <textarea\n        placeholder=\"Message\"\n        value={message}\n        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nfunction sendMessage(message) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere’s what happens when you click the button:\n\nThe onSubmit event handler executes.\nsetIsSent(true) sets isSent to true and queues a new render.\nReact re-renders the component according to the new isSent value.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the relationship between state and rendering.\n\nRendering takes a snapshot in time \n\n“Rendering” means that React is calling your component, which is a function. The JSX you return from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time. Its props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated using its state at the time of the render.\n\nUnlike a photograph or a movie frame, the UI “snapshot” you return is interactive. It includes logic like event handlers that specify what happens in response to inputs. React updates the screen to match this snapshot and connects the event handlers. As a result, pressing a button will trigger the click handler from your JSX.\n\nWhen React re-renders a component:\n\nReact calls your function again.\nYour function returns a new JSX snapshot.\nReact then updates the screen to match the snapshot your function returned.\nReact executing the function\nCalculating the snapshot\nUpdating the DOM tree\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nAs a component’s memory, state is not like a regular variable that disappears after your function returns. State actually “lives” in React itself—as if on a shelf!—outside of your function. When React calls your component, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render. Your component returns a snapshot of the UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, all calculated using the state values from that render!\n\nYou tell React to update the state\nReact updates the state value\nReact passes a snapshot of the state value into the component\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nHere’s a little experiment to show you how this works. In this example, you might expect that clicking the “+3” button would increment the counter three times because it calls setNumber(number + 1) three times.\n\nSee what happens when you click the “+3” button:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{number}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setNumber(number + 1);\n        setNumber(number + 1);\n        setNumber(number + 1);\n      }}>+3</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that number only increments once per click!\n\nSetting state only changes it for the next render. During the first render, number was 0. This is why, in that render’s onClick handler, the value of number is still 0 even after setNumber(number + 1) was called:\n\n<button onClick={() => {\n\n  setNumber(number + 1);\n\n  setNumber(number + 1);\n\n  setNumber(number + 1);\n\n}}>+3</button>\n\nHere is what this button’s click handler tells React to do:\n\nsetNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).\nReact prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.\nsetNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).\nReact prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.\nsetNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).\nReact prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.\n\nEven though you called setNumber(number + 1) three times, in this render’s event handler number is always 0, so you set the state to 1 three times. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with number equal to 1 rather than 3.\n\nYou can also visualize this by mentally substituting state variables with their values in your code. Since the number state variable is 0 for this render, its event handler looks like this:\n\n<button onClick={() => {\n\n  setNumber(0 + 1);\n\n  setNumber(0 + 1);\n\n  setNumber(0 + 1);\n\n}}>+3</button>\n\nFor the next render, number is 1, so that render’s click handler looks like this:\n\n<button onClick={() => {\n\n  setNumber(1 + 1);\n\n  setNumber(1 + 1);\n\n  setNumber(1 + 1);\n\n}}>+3</button>\n\nThis is why clicking the button again will set the counter to 2, then to 3 on the next click, and so on.\n\nState over time \n\nWell, that was fun.

If you use the substitution method, you can see the “snapshot” of the state passed to the alert.\n\nsetNumber(0 + 5);\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n\n  alert(0);\n\n}, 3000);\n\nThe state stored in React may have changed by the time the alert runs, but it was scheduled using a snapshot of the state at the time the user interacted with it!\n\nA state variable’s value never changes within a render, even if its event handler’s code is asynchronous. Inside that render’s onClick, the value of number continues to be 0 even after setNumber(number + 5) was called. Its value was “fixed” when React “took the snapshot” of the UI by calling your component.\n\nHere is an example of how that makes your event handlers less prone to timing mistakes.

But sometimes you might want to perform multiple operations on the value before queueing the next render. To do this, it helps to understand how React batches state updates.\n\nYou will learn\nWhat “batching” is and how React uses it to process multiple state updates\nHow to apply several updates to the same state variable in a row\nReact batches state updates \n\nYou might expect that clicking the “+3” button will increment the counter three times because it calls setNumber(number + 1) three times:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{number}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setNumber(number + 1);\n        setNumber(number + 1);\n        setNumber(number + 1);\n      }}>+3</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHowever, as you might recall from the previous section, each render’s state values are fixed, so the value of number inside the first render’s event handler is always 0, no matter how many times you call setNumber(1):\n\nsetNumber(0 + 1);\n\nsetNumber(0 + 1);\n\nsetNumber(0 + 1);\n\nBut there is one other factor at play here. React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. This is why the re-render only happens after all these setNumber() calls.\n\nThis might remind you of a waiter taking an order at the restaurant. A waiter doesn’t run to the kitchen at the mention of your first dish! Instead, they let you finish your order, let you make changes to it, and even take orders from other people at the table.\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nThis lets you update multiple state variables—even from multiple components—without triggering too many re-renders. But this also means that the UI won’t be updated until after your event handler, and any code in it, completes. This behavior, also known as batching, makes your React app run much faster. It also avoids dealing with confusing “half-finished” renders where only some of the variables have been updated.\n\nReact does not batch across multiple intentional events like clicks—each click is handled separately. Rest assured that React only does batching when it’s generally safe to do. This ensures that, for example, if the first button click disables a form, the second click would not submit it again.\n\nUpdating the same state multiple times before the next render \n\nIt is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the next state value like setNumber(number + 1), you can pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like setNumber(n => n + 1). It is a way to tell React to “do something with the state value” instead of just replacing it.\n\nTry incrementing the counter now:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{number}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n      }}>+3</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere, n => n + 1 is called an updater function. When you pass it to a state setter:\n\nReact queues this function to be processed after all the other code in the event handler has run.\nDuring the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state.\nsetNumber(n => n + 1);\n\nsetNumber(n => n + 1);\n\nsetNumber(n => n + 1);\n\nHere’s how React works through these lines of code while executing the event handler:\n\nsetNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.\nsetNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.\nsetNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.\n\nWhen you call useState during the next render, React goes through the queue. The previous number state was 0, so that’s what React passes to the first updater function as the n argument. Then React takes the return value of your previous updater function and passes it to the next updater as n, and so on:\n\nqueued update\tn\treturns\nn => n + 1\t0\t0 + 1 = 1\nn => n + 1\t1\t1 + 1 = 2\nn => n + 1\t2\t2 + 1 = 3\n\nReact stores 3 as the final result and returns it from useState.\n\nThis is why clicking “+3” in the above example correctly increments the value by 3.\n\nWhat happens if you update state after replacing it \n\nWhat about this event handler? What do you think number will be in the next render?\n\n<button onClick={() => {\n\n  setNumber(number + 5);\n\n  setNumber(n => n + 1);\n\n}}>\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{number}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setNumber(number + 5);\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n      }}>Increase the number</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\n\nHere’s what this event handler tells React to do:\n\nsetNumber(number + 5): number is 0, so setNumber(0 + 5). React adds “replace with 5” to its queue.\nsetNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is an updater function. React adds that function to its queue.\n\nDuring the next render, React goes through the state queue:\n\nqueued update\tn\treturns\n“replace with 5”\t0 (unused)\t5\nn => n + 1\t5\t5 + 1 = 6\n\nReact stores 6 as the final result and returns it from useState.\n\nNote\n\nYou may have noticed that setState(5) actually works like setState(n => 5), but n is unused!\n\nWhat happens if you replace state after updating it \n\nLet’s try one more example. What do you think number will be in the next render?\n\n<button onClick={() => {\n\n  setNumber(number + 5);\n\n  setNumber(n => n + 1);\n\n  setNumber(42);\n\n}}>\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{number}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setNumber(number + 5);\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n        setNumber(42);\n      }}>Increase the number</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere’s how React works through these lines of code while executing this event handler:\n\nsetNumber(number + 5): number is 0, so setNumber(0 + 5). React adds “replace with 5” to its queue.\nsetNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is an updater function. React adds that function to its queue.\nsetNumber(42): React adds “replace with 42” to its queue.\n\nDuring the next render, React goes through the state queue:\n\nqueued update\tn\treturns\n“replace with 5”\t0 (unused)\t5\nn => n + 1\t5\t5 + 1 = 6\n“replace with 42”\t6 (unused)\t42\n\nThen React stores 42 as the final result and returns it from useState.\n\nTo summarize, here’s how you can think of what you’re passing to the setNumber state setter:\n\nAn updater function (e.g. n => n + 1) gets added to the queue.\nAny other value (e.g. number 5) adds “replace with 5” to the queue, ignoring what’s already queued.\n\nAfter the event handler completes, React will trigger a re-render. During the re-render, React will process the queue. Updater functions run during rendering, so updater functions must be pure and only return the result. Don’t try to set state from inside of them or run other side effects. In Strict Mode, React will run each updater function twice (but discard the second result) to help you find mistakes.\n\nNaming conventions \n\nIt’s common to name the updater function argument by the first letters of the corresponding state variable:\n\nsetEnabled(e => !e);\n\nsetLastName(ln => ln.reverse());\n\nsetFriendCount(fc => fc * 2);\n\nIf you prefer more verbose code, another common convention is to repeat the full state variable name, like setEnabled(enabled => !enabled), or to use a prefix like setEnabled(prevEnabled => !prevEnabled).\n\nRecap\nSetting state does not change the variable in the existing render, but it requests a new render.\nReact processes state updates after event handlers have finished running. This is called batching.\nTo update some state multiple times in one event, you can use setNumber(n => n + 1) updater function.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Fix a request counter\n2. Implement the state queue yourself\nChallenge 1 of 2: Fix a request counter \n\nYou’re working on an art marketplace app that lets the user submit multiple orders for an art item at the same time. Each time the user presses the “Buy” button, the “Pending” counter should increase by one. After three seconds, the “Pending” counter should decrease, and the “Completed” counter should increase.\n\nHowever, the “Pending” counter does not behave as intended. When you press “Buy”, it decreases to -1 (which should not be possible!). And if you click fast twice, both counters seem to behave unpredictably.\n\nWhy does this happen? Fix both counters.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function RequestTracker() {\n  const [pending, setPending] = useState(0);\n  const [completed, setCompleted] = useState(0);\n\n  async function handleClick() {\n    setPending(pending + 1);\n    await delay(3000);\n    setPending(pending - 1);\n    setCompleted(completed + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h3>\n        Pending: {pending}\n      </h3>\n      <h3>\n        Completed: {completed}\n      </h3>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Buy     \n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction delay(ms) {\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    setTimeout(resolve, ms);\n  });\n}\n\n\nShow more\nShow solution\nNext Challenge\nPREVIOUS\nState as a Snapshot\nNEXT\nUpdating Objects in State"

Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about how your code executes and explain its behavior.\n\nYou will learn\nWhat rendering means in React\nWhen and why React renders a component\nThe steps involved in displaying a component on screen\nWhy rendering does not always produce a DOM update\n\nImagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders. This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:\n\nTriggering a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)\nRendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)\nCommitting to the DOM (placing the order on the table)\nTrigger\nRender\nCommit\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nStep 1: Trigger a render \n\nThere are two reasons for a component to render:\n\nIt’s the component’s initial render.\nThe component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.\nInitial render \n\nWhen your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render. Frameworks and sandboxes sometimes hide this code, but it’s done by calling createRoot with the target DOM node, and then calling its render method with your component:\n\nindex.js\nImage.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Image from './Image.js';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))\nroot.render(<Image />);\n\n\n\nTry commenting out the root.render() call and see the component disappear!\n\nRe-renders when state updates \n\nOnce the component has been initially rendered, you can trigger further renders by updating its state with the set function. Updating your component’s state automatically queues a render. (You can imagine these as a restaurant guest ordering tea, dessert, and all sorts of things after putting in their first order, depending on the state of their thirst or hunger.)\n\nState update...\n...triggers...\n...render!\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nStep 2: React renders your components \n\nAfter you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components.\n\nOn initial render, React will call the root component.\nFor subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.\n\nThis process is recursive: if the updated component returns some other component, React will render that component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render that component next, and so on. The process will continue until there are no more nested components and React knows exactly what should be displayed on screen.\n\nIn the following example, React will call Gallery() and  Image() several times:\n\nGallery.js\nindex.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Gallery() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Inspiring Sculptures</h1>\n      <Image />\n      <Image />\n      <Image />\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Image() {\n  return (\n    <img\n      src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg\"\n      alt=\"'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals\"\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDuring the initial render, React will create the DOM nodes for <section>, <h1>, and three <img> tags.\nDuring a re-render, React will calculate which of their properties, if any, have changed since the previous render. It won’t do anything with that information until the next step, the commit phase.\nPitfall\n\nRendering must always be a pure calculation:\n\nSame inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX. (When someone orders a salad with tomatoes, they should not receive a salad with onions!)\nIt minds its own business. It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering. (One order should not change anyone else’s order.)\n\nOtherwise, you can encounter confusing bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows in complexity. When developing in “Strict Mode”, React calls each component’s function twice, which can help surface mistakes caused by impure functions.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nOptimizing performance \nShow Details\nStep 3: React commits changes to the DOM \n\nAfter rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM.\n\nFor the initial render, React will use the appendChild() DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.\nFor re-renders, React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.\n\nReact only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders. For example, here is a component that re-renders with different props passed from its parent every second. Notice how you can add some text into the <input>, updating its value, but the text doesn’t disappear when the component re-renders:\n\nClock.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Clock({ time }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{time}</h1>\n      <input />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis works because during this last step, React only updates the content of <h1> with the new time. It sees that the <input> appears in the JSX in the same place as last time, so React doesn’t touch the <input>—or its value!\n\nEpilogue: Browser paint \n\nAfter rendering is done and React updated the DOM, the browser will repaint the screen. Although this process is known as “browser rendering”, we’ll refer to it as “painting” to avoid confusion throughout the docs.\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nRecap\nAny screen update in a React app happens in three steps:\nTrigger\nRender\nCommit\nYou can use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components\nReact does not touch the DOM if the rendering result is the same as last time\nPREVIOUS\nState: A Component's Memory\nNEXT\nState as a Snapshot"

But two things prevent that change from being visible:\n\nLocal variables don’t persist between renders.

React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.\n\nTo update a component with new data, two things need to happen:\n\nRetain the data between renders.\nTrigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).\n\nThe useState Hook provides those two things:\n\nA state variable to retain the data between renders.\nA state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.\nAdding a state variable \n\nTo add a state variable, import useState from React at the top of the file:\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nThen, replace this line:\n\nlet index = 0;\n\nwith\n\nconst [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n\nindex is a state variable and setIndex is the setter function.\n\nThe [ and ] syntax here is called array destructuring and it lets you read values from an array.

They let you “hook into” different React features.\n\nState is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.\n\nPitfall\n\nHooks—functions starting with use—can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks. You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.\n\nAnatomy of useState \n\nWhen you call useState, you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:\n\nconst [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n\nIn this case, you want React to remember index.\n\nNote\n\nThe convention is to name this pair like const [something, setSomething]. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.\n\nThe only argument to useState is the initial value of your state variable. In this example, the index’s initial value is set to 0 with useState(0).\n\nEvery time your component renders, useState gives you an array containing two values:\n\nThe state variable (index) with the value you stored.\nThe state setter function (setIndex) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.\n\nHere’s how that happens in action:\n\nconst [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\nYour component renders the first time. Because you passed 0 to useState as the initial value for index, it will return [0, setIndex]. React remembers 0 is the latest state value.\nYou update the state. When a user clicks the button, it calls setIndex(index + 1). index is 0, so it’s setIndex(1). This tells React to remember index is 1 now and triggers another render.\nYour component’s second render. React still sees useState(0), but because React remembers that you set index to 1, it returns [1, setIndex] instead.\nAnd so on!\nGiving a component multiple state variables \n\nYou can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number index and a boolean showMore that’s toggled when you click “Show details”:\n\nApp.js\ndata.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { sculptureList } from './data.js';\n\nexport default function Gallery() {\n  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);\n\n  function handleNextClick() {\n    setIndex(index + 1);\n  }\n\n  function handleMoreClick() {\n    setShowMore(!showMore);\n  }\n\n  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n      <h2>\n        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> \n        by {sculpture.artist}\n      </h2>\n      <h3>  \n        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})\n      </h3>\n      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>\n        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details\n      </button>\n      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}\n      <img \n        src={sculpture.url} \n        alt={sculpture.alt}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIt is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like index and showMore in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read Choosing the State Structure for more tips.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow does React know which state to return? \nShow Details\nState is isolated and private \n\nState is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state! Changing one of them will not affect the other.\n\nIn this example, the Gallery component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:\n\nApp.js\nGallery.js\ndata.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Gallery from './Gallery.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"Page\">\n      <Gallery />\n      <Gallery />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two <Gallery /> components, so their state is stored separately.\n\nAlso notice how the Page component doesn’t “know” anything about the Gallery state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it. The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.\n\nWhat if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to remove state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in Sharing State Between Components.\n\nRecap\nUse a state variable when a component needs to “remember” some information between renders.\nState variables are declared by calling the useState Hook.\nHooks are special functions that start with use. They let you “hook into” React features like state.\nHooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including useState, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.\nThe useState Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.\nYou can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.\nState is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.\nTry out some challenges\n1.

Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” puts a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.\n\nYou can add state to a component with a useState Hook. Hooks are special functions that let your components use React features (state is one of those features). The useState Hook lets you declare a state variable. It takes the initial state and returns a pair of values: the current state, and a state setter function that lets you update it.\n\nconst [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n\nconst [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);\n\nHere is how an image gallery uses and updates state on click:\n\nApp.js\ndata.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { sculptureList } from './data.js';\n\nexport default function Gallery() {\n  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);\n  const hasNext = index < sculptureList.length - 1;\n\n  function handleNextClick() {\n    if (hasNext) {\n      setIndex(index + 1);\n    } else {\n      setIndex(0);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function handleMoreClick() {\n    setShowMore(!showMore);\n  }\n\n  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n      <h2>\n        <i>{sculpture.name} </i>\n        by {sculpture.artist}\n      </h2>\n      <h3>\n        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})\n      </h3>\n      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>\n        {showMore ?

Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about how your code executes and explain its behavior.\n\nImagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders. This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:\n\nTriggering a render (delivering the diner’s order to the kitchen)\nRendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)\nCommitting to the DOM (placing the order on the table)\nTrigger\nRender\nCommit\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nReady to learn this topic?\n\nRead Render and Commit to learn the lifecycle of a UI update.\n\nRead More\nState as a snapshot \n\nUnlike regular JavaScript variables, React state behaves more like a snapshot. Setting it does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render.

But you shouldn’t change objects and arrays that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object and array, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then update the state to use that copy.\n\nUsually, you will use the ... spread syntax to copy objects and arrays that you want to change.

Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.\n\nYou will learn\nDifferent ways to write an event handler\nHow to pass event handling logic from a parent component\nHow events propagate and how to stop them\nAdding event handlers \n\nTo add an event handler, you will first define a function and then pass it as a prop to the appropriate JSX tag. For example, here is a button that doesn’t do anything yet:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nexport default function Button() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      I don't do anything\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nYou can make it show a message when a user clicks by following these three steps:\n\nDeclare a function called handleClick inside your Button component.\nImplement the logic inside that function (use alert to show the message).\nAdd onClick={handleClick} to the <button> JSX.\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nexport default function Button() {\n  function handleClick() {\n    alert('You clicked me!');\n  }\n\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nYou defined the handleClick function and then passed it as a prop to <button>.  handleClick is an event handler. Event handler functions:\n\nAre usually defined inside your components.\nHave names that start with handle, followed by the name of the event.\n\nBy convention, it is common to name event handlers as handle followed by the event name. You’ll often see onClick={handleClick}, onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, you can define an event handler inline in the JSX:\n\n<button onClick={function handleClick() {\n\n  alert('You clicked me!');\n\n}}>\n\nOr, more concisely, using an arrow function:\n\n<button onClick={() => {\n\n  alert('You clicked me!');\n\n}}>\n\nAll of these styles are equivalent. Inline event handlers are convenient for short functions.\n\nPitfall\n\nFunctions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called. For example:\n\npassing a function (correct)\tcalling a function (incorrect)\n<button onClick={handleClick}>\t<button onClick={handleClick()}>\n\nThe difference is subtle. In the first example, the handleClick function is passed as an onClick event handler. This tells React to remember it and only call your function when the user clicks the button.\n\nIn the second example, the () at the end of handleClick() fires the function immediately during rendering, without any clicks. This is because JavaScript inside the JSX { and } executes right away.\n\nWhen you write code inline, the same pitfall presents itself in a different way:\n\npassing a function (correct)\tcalling a function (incorrect)\n<button onClick={() => alert('...')}>\t<button onClick={alert('...')}>\n\nPassing inline code like this won’t fire on click—it fires every time the component renders:\n\n// This alert fires when the component renders, not when clicked!\n\n<button onClick={alert('You clicked me!')}>\n\nIf you want to define your event handler inline, wrap it in an anonymous function like so:\n\n<button onClick={() => alert('You clicked me!')}>\n\nRather than executing the code inside with every render, this creates a function to be called later.\n\nIn both cases, what you want to pass is a function:\n\n<button onClick={handleClick}> passes the handleClick function.\n<button onClick={() => alert('...')}> passes the () => alert('...') function.\n\nRead more about arrow functions.\n\nReading props in event handlers \n\nBecause event handlers are declared inside of a component, they have access to the component’s props. Here is a button that, when clicked, shows an alert with its message prop:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction AlertButton({ message, children }) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => alert(message)}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Toolbar() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <AlertButton message=\"Playing!\">\n        Play Movie\n      </AlertButton>\n      <AlertButton message=\"Uploading!\">\n        Upload Image\n      </AlertButton>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis lets these two buttons show different messages. Try changing the messages passed to them.\n\nPassing event handlers as props \n\nOften you’ll want the parent component to specify a child’s event handler. Consider buttons: depending on where you’re using a Button component, you might want to execute a different function—perhaps one plays a movie and another uploads an image.\n\nTo do this, pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event handler like so:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Button({ onClick, children }) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PlayButton({ movieName }) {\n  function handlePlayClick() {\n    alert(`Playing ${movieName}!`);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <Button onClick={handlePlayClick}>\n      Play \"{movieName}\"\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction UploadButton() {\n  return (\n    <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>\n      Upload Image\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Toolbar() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PlayButton movieName=\"Kiki's Delivery Service\" />\n      <UploadButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere, the Toolbar component renders a PlayButton and an UploadButton:\n\nPlayButton passes handlePlayClick as the onClick prop to the Button inside.\nUploadButton passes () => alert('Uploading!') as the onClick prop to the Button inside.\n\nFinally, your Button component accepts a prop called onClick. It passes that prop directly to the built-in browser <button> with onClick={onClick}. This tells React to call the passed function on click.\n\nIf you use a design system, it’s common for components like buttons to contain styling but not specify behavior. Instead, components like PlayButton and UploadButton will pass event handlers down.\n\nNaming event handler props \n\nBuilt-in components like <button> and <div> only support browser event names like onClick. However, when you’re building your own components, you can name their event handler props any way that you like.\n\nBy convention, event handler props should start with on, followed by a capital letter.\n\nFor example, the Button component’s onClick prop could have been called onSmash:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Button({ onSmash, children }) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onSmash}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Playing!')}>\n        Play Movie\n      </Button>\n      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Uploading!')}>\n        Upload Image\n      </Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn this example, <button onClick={onSmash}> shows that the browser <button> (lowercase) still needs a prop called onClick, but the prop name received by your custom Button component is up to you!\n\nWhen your component supports multiple interactions, you might name event handler props for app-specific concepts. For example, this Toolbar component receives onPlayMovie and onUploadImage event handlers:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Toolbar\n      onPlayMovie={() => alert('Playing!')}\n      onUploadImage={() => alert('Uploading!')}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}>\n        Play Movie\n      </Button>\n      <Button onClick={onUploadImage}>\n        Upload Image\n      </Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Button({ onClick, children }) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how the App component does not need to know what Toolbar will do with onPlayMovie or onUploadImage. That’s an implementation detail of the Toolbar. Here, Toolbar passes them down as onClick handlers to its Buttons, but it could later also trigger them on a keyboard shortcut. Naming props after app-specific interactions like onPlayMovie gives you the flexibility to change how they’re used later.\n\nNote\n\nMake sure that you use the appropriate HTML tags for your event handlers. For example, to handle clicks, use <button onClick={handleClick}> instead of <div onClick={handleClick}>. Using a real browser <button> enables built-in browser behaviors like keyboard navigation. If you don’t like the default browser styling of a button and want to make it look more like a link or a different UI element, you can achieve it with CSS. Learn more about writing accessible markup.\n\nEvent propagation \n\nEvent handlers will also catch events from any children your component might have. We say that an event “bubbles” or “propagates” up the tree: it starts with where the event happened, and then goes up the tree.\n\nThis <div> contains two buttons. Both the <div> and each button have their own onClick handlers. Which handlers do you think will fire when you click a button?\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Toolbar() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"Toolbar\" onClick={() => {\n      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');\n    }}>\n      <button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>\n        Play Movie\n      </button>\n      <button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>\n        Upload Image\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nIf you click on either button, its onClick will run first, followed by the parent <div>’s onClick. So two messages will appear. If you click the toolbar itself, only the parent <div>’s onClick will run.\n\nPitfall\n\nAll events propagate in React except onScroll, which only works on the JSX tag you attach it to.\n\nStopping propagation \n\nEvent handlers receive an event object as their only argument. By convention, it’s usually called e, which stands for “event”. You can use this object to read information about the event.\n\nThat event object also lets you stop the propagation. If you want to prevent an event from reaching parent components, you need to call e.stopPropagation() like this Button component does:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Button({ onClick, children }) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={e => {\n      e.stopPropagation();\n      onClick();\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Toolbar() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"Toolbar\" onClick={() => {\n      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');\n    }}>\n      <Button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>\n        Play Movie\n      </Button>\n      <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>\n        Upload Image\n      </Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you click on a button:\n\nReact calls the onClick handler passed to <button>.\nThat handler, defined in Button, does the following:\nCalls e.stopPropagation(), preventing the event from bubbling further.\nCalls the onClick function, which is a prop passed from the Toolbar component.\nThat function, defined in the Toolbar component, displays the button’s own alert.\nSince the propagation was stopped, the parent <div>’s onClick handler does not run.\n\nAs a result of e.stopPropagation(), clicking on the buttons now only shows a single alert (from the <button>) rather than the two of them (from the <button> and the parent toolbar <div>). Clicking a button is not the same thing as clicking the surrounding toolbar, so stopping the propagation makes sense for this UI.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nCapture phase events \nShow Details\nPassing handlers as alternative to propagation \n\nNotice how this click handler runs a line of code and then calls the onClick prop passed by the parent:\n\nfunction Button({ onClick, children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <button onClick={e => {\n\n      e.stopPropagation();\n\n      onClick();\n\n    }}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou could add more code to this handler before calling the parent onClick event handler, too. This pattern provides an alternative to propagation. It lets the child component handle the event, while also letting the parent component specify some additional behavior. Unlike propagation, it’s not automatic. But the benefit of this pattern is that you can clearly follow the whole chain of code that executes as a result of some event.\n\nIf you rely on propagation and it’s difficult to trace which handlers execute and why, try this approach instead.\n\nPreventing default behavior \n\nSome browser events have default behavior associated with them. For example, a <form> submit event, which happens when a button inside of it is clicked, will reload the whole page by default:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Signup() {\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={() => alert('Submitting!')}>\n      <input />\n      <button>Send</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nYou can call e.preventDefault() on the event object to stop this from happening:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Signup() {\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={e => {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      alert('Submitting!');\n    }}>\n      <input />\n      <button>Send</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nDon’t confuse e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault(). They are both useful, but are unrelated:\n\ne.stopPropagation() stops the event handlers attached to the tags above from firing.\ne.preventDefault() prevents the default browser behavior for the few events that have it.\nCan event handlers have side effects? \n\nAbsolutely! Event handlers are the best place for side effects.\n\nUnlike rendering functions, event handlers don’t need to be pure, so it’s a great place to change something—for example, change an input’s value in response to typing, or change a list in response to a button press. However, in order to change some information, you first need some way to store it. In React, this is done by using state, a component’s memory. You will learn all about it on the next page.\n\nRecap\nYou can handle events by passing a function as a prop to an element like <button>.\nEvent handlers must be passed, not called! onClick={handleClick}, not onClick={handleClick()}.\nYou can define an event handler function separately or inline.\nEvent handlers are defined inside a component, so they can access props.\nYou can declare an event handler in a parent and pass it as a prop to a child.\nYou can define your own event handler props with application-specific names.\nEvents propagate upwards. Call e.stopPropagation() on the first argument to prevent that.\nEvents may have unwanted default browser behavior. Call e.preventDefault() to prevent that.\nExplicitly calling an event handler prop from a child handler is a good alternative to propagation.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Fix an event handler\n2.

    "html": "DESCRIBING THE UI\nUnderstanding Your UI as a Tree\n\nYour React app is taking shape with many components being nested within each other. How does React keep track of your app’s component structure?\n\nReact, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree. Thinking of your app as a tree is useful for understanding the relationship between components. This understanding will help you debug future concepts like performance and state management.\n\nYou will learn\nHow React “sees” component structures\nWhat a render tree is and what it is useful for\nWhat a module dependency tree is and what it is useful for\nYour UI as a tree \n\nTrees are a relationship model between items and UI is often represented using tree structures. For example, browsers use tree structures to model HTML (DOM) and CSS (CSSOM). Mobile platforms also use trees to represent their view hierarchy.\n\nReact creates a UI tree from your components. In this example, the UI tree is then used to render to the DOM.\n\nLike browsers and mobile platforms, React also uses tree structures to manage and model the relationship between components in a React app. These trees are useful tools to understand how data flows through a React app and how to optimize rendering and app size.\n\nThe Render Tree \n\nA major feature of components is the ability to compose components of other components. As we nest components, we have the concept of parent and child components, where each parent component may itself be a child of another component.\n\nWhen we render a React app, we can model this relationship in a tree, known as the render tree.\n\nHere is a React app that renders inspirational quotes.\n\nApp.js\nFancyText.js\nInspirationGenerator.js\nCopyright.js\nquotes.js\nReset\nFork\nimport FancyText from './FancyText';\nimport InspirationGenerator from './InspirationGenerator';\nimport Copyright from './Copyright';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <FancyText title text=\"Get Inspired App\" />\n      <InspirationGenerator>\n        <Copyright year={2004} />\n      </InspirationGenerator>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nReact creates a render tree, a UI tree, composed of the rendered components.\n\nFrom the example app, we can construct the above render tree.\n\nThe tree is composed of nodes, each of which represents a component. App, FancyText, Copyright, to name a few, are all nodes in our tree.\n\nThe root node in a React render tree is the root component of the app. In this case, the root component is App and it is the first component React renders. Each arrow in the tree points from a parent component to a child component.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhere are the HTML tags in the render tree? \nShow Details\n\nA render tree represents a single render pass of a React application. With conditional rendering, a parent component may render different children depending on the data passed.\n\nWe can update the app to conditionally render either an inspirational quote or color.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport FancyText from './FancyText';\nimport InspirationGenerator from './InspirationGenerator';\nimport Copyright from './Copyright';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <FancyText title text=\"Get Inspired App\" />\n      <InspirationGenerator>\n        <Copyright year={2004} />\n      </InspirationGenerator>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nWith conditional rendering, across different renders, the render tree may render different components.\n\nIn this example, depending on what inspiration.type is, we may render <FancyText> or <Color>. The render tree may be different for each render pass.\n\nAlthough render trees may differ across render passes, these trees are generally helpful for identifying what the top-level and leaf components are in a React app. Top-level components are the components nearest to the root component and affect the rendering performance of all the components beneath them and often contain the most complexity. Leaf components are near the bottom of the tree and have no child components and are often frequently re-rendered.\n\nIdentifying these categories of components are useful for understanding data flow and performance of your app.\n\nThe Module Dependency Tree \n\nAnother relationship in a React app that can be modeled with a tree are an app’s module dependencies. As we break up our components and logic into separate files, we create JS modules where we may export components, functions, or constants.\n\nEach node in a module dependency tree is a module and each branch represents an import statement in that module.\n\nIf we take the previous Inspirations app, we can build a module dependency tree, or dependency tree for short.\n\nThe module dependency tree for the Inspirations app.\n\nThe root node of the tree is the root module, also known as the entrypoint file. It often is the module that contains the root component.\n\nComparing to the render tree of the same app, there are similar structures but some notable differences:\n\nThe nodes that make-up the tree represent modules, not components.\nNon-component modules, like inspirations.js, are also represented in this tree. The render tree only encapsulates components.\nCopyright.js appears under App.js but in the render tree, Copyright, the component, appears as a child of InspirationGenerator. This is because InspirationGenerator accepts JSX as children props, so it renders Copyright as a child component but does not import the module.\n\nDependency trees are useful to determine what modules are necessary to run your React app. When building a React app for production, there is typically a build step that will bundle all the necessary JavaScript to ship to the client. The tool responsible for this is called a bundler, and bundlers will use the dependency tree to determine what modules should be included.\n\nAs your app grows, often the bundle size does too. Large bundle sizes are expensive for a client to download and run. Large bundle sizes can delay the time for your UI to get drawn. Getting a sense of your app’s dependency tree may help with debugging these issues.\n\nRecap\nTrees are a common way to represent the relationship between entities. They are often used to model UI.\nRender trees represent the nested relationship between React components across a single render.\nWith conditional rendering, the render tree may change across different renders. With different prop values, components may render different children components.\nRender trees help identify what the top-level and leaf components are. Top-level components affect the rendering performance of all components beneath them and leaf components are often re-rendered frequently. Identifying them is useful for understanding and debugging rendering performance.\nDependency trees represent the module dependencies in a React app.\nDependency trees are used by build tools to bundle the necessary code to ship an app.\nDependency trees are useful for debugging large bundle sizes that slow time to paint and expose opportunities for optimizing what code is bundled.\nPREVIOUS\nKeeping Components Pure\nNEXT\nAdding Interactivity"

    "title": "Keeping Components Pure – React",
    "url": "https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure",
    "html": "DESCRIBING THE UI\nKeeping Components Pure\n\nSome JavaScript functions are pure. Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more. By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. To get these benefits, though, there are a few rules you must follow.\n\nYou will learn\nWhat purity is and how it helps you avoid bugs\nHow to keep components pure by keeping changes out of the render phase\nHow to use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components\nPurity: Components as formulas \n\nIn computer science (and especially the world of functional programming), a pure function is a function with the following characteristics:\n\nIt minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.\nSame inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.\n\nYou might already be familiar with one example of pure functions: formulas in math.\n\nConsider this math formula: y = 2x.\n\nIf x = 2 then y = 4. Always.\n\nIf x = 3 then y = 6. Always.\n\nIf x = 3, y won’t sometimes be 9 or –1 or 2.5 depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market.\n\nIf y = 2x and x = 3, y will always be 6.\n\nIf we made this into a JavaScript function, it would look like this:\n\nfunction double(number) {\n\n  return 2 * number;\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, double is a pure function. If you pass it 3, it will return 6. Always.\n\nReact is designed around this concept. React assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Recipe({ drinkers }) {\n  return (\n    <ol>    \n      <li>Boil {drinkers} cups of water.</li>\n      <li>Add {drinkers} spoons of tea and {0.5 * drinkers} spoons of spice.</li>\n      <li>Add {0.5 * drinkers} cups of milk to boil and sugar to taste.</li>\n    </ol>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Spiced Chai Recipe</h1>\n      <h2>For two</h2>\n      <Recipe drinkers={2} />\n      <h2>For a gathering</h2>\n      <Recipe drinkers={4} />\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you pass drinkers={2} to Recipe, it will return JSX containing 2 cups of water. Always.\n\nIf you pass drinkers={4}, it will return JSX containing 4 cups of water. Always.\n\nJust like a math formula.\n\nYou could think of your components as recipes: if you follow them and don’t introduce new ingredients during the cooking process, you will get the same dish every time. That “dish” is the JSX that the component serves to React to render.\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nSide Effects: (un)intended consequences \n\nReact’s rendering process must always be pure. Components should only return their JSX, and not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering—that would make them impure!\n\nHere is a component that breaks this rule:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nlet guest = 0;\n\nfunction Cup() {\n  // Bad: changing a preexisting variable!\n  guest = guest + 1;\n  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;\n}\n\nexport default function TeaSet() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Cup />\n      <Cup />\n      <Cup />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis component is reading and writing a guest variable declared outside of it. This means that calling this component multiple times will produce different JSX! And what’s more, if other components read guest, they will produce different JSX, too, depending on when they were rendered! That’s not predictable.\n\nGoing back to our formula y = 2x, now even if x = 2, we cannot trust that y = 4. Our tests could fail, our users would be baffled, planes would fall out of the sky—you can see how this would lead to confusing bugs!\n\nYou can fix this component by passing guest as a prop instead:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Cup({ guest }) {\n  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;\n}\n\nexport default function TeaSet() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Cup guest={1} />\n      <Cup guest={2} />\n      <Cup guest={3} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nNow your component is pure, as the JSX it returns only depends on the guest prop.\n\nIn general, you should not expect your components to be rendered in any particular order. It doesn’t matter if you call y = 2x before or after y = 5x: both formulas will resolve independently of each other. In the same way, each component should only “think for itself”, and not attempt to coordinate with or depend upon others during rendering. Rendering is like a school exam: each component should calculate JSX on their own!\n\nDEEP DIVE\nDetecting impure calculations with StrictMode \nShow Details\nLocal mutation: Your component’s little secret \n\nIn the above example, the problem was that the component changed a preexisting variable while rendering. This is often called a “mutation” to make it sound a bit scarier. Pure functions don’t mutate variables outside of the function’s scope or objects that were created before the call—that makes them impure!\n\nHowever, it’s completely fine to change variables and objects that you’ve just created while rendering. In this example, you create an [] array, assign it to a cups variable, and then push a dozen cups into it:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Cup({ guest }) {\n  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;\n}\n\nexport default function TeaGathering() {\n  let cups = [];\n  for (let i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {\n    cups.push(<Cup key={i} guest={i} />);\n  }\n  return cups;\n}\n\n\n\nIf the cups variable or the [] array were created outside the TeaGathering function, this would be a huge problem! You would be changing a preexisting object by pushing items into that array.\n\nHowever, it’s fine because you’ve created them during the same render, inside TeaGathering. No code outside of TeaGathering will ever know that this happened. This is called “local mutation”—it’s like your component’s little secret.\n\nWhere you can cause side effects \n\nWhile functional programming relies heavily on purity, at some point, somewhere, something has to change. That’s kind of the point of programming! These changes—updating the screen, starting an animation, changing the data—are called side effects. They’re things that happen “on the side”, not during rendering.\n\nIn React, side effects usually belong inside event handlers. Event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action—for example, when you click a button. Even though event handlers are defined inside your component, they don’t run during rendering! So event handlers don’t need to be pure.\n\nIf you’ve exhausted all other options and can’t find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with a useEffect call in your component. This tells React to execute it later, after rendering, when side effects are allowed. However, this approach should be your last resort.\n\nWhen possible, try to express your logic with rendering alone. You’ll be surprised how far this can take you!\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy does React care about purity? \nShow Details\nRecap\nA component must be pure, meaning:\nIt minds its own business. It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering.\nSame inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX.\nRendering can happen at any time, so components should not depend on each others’ rendering sequence.\nYou should not mutate any of the inputs that your components use for rendering. That includes props, state, and context. To update the screen, “set” state instead of mutating preexisting objects.\nStrive to express your component’s logic in the JSX you return. When you need to “change things”, you’ll usually want to do it in an event handler. As a last resort, you can useEffect.\nWriting pure functions takes a bit of practice, but it unlocks the power of React’s paradigm.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Fix a broken clock\n2.

In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to return different JSX depending on a condition\nHow to conditionally include or exclude a piece of JSX\nCommon conditional syntax shortcuts you’ll encounter in React codebases\nConditionally returning JSX \n\nLet’s say you have a PackingList component rendering several Items, which can be marked as packed or not:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nfunction Item({ name, isPacked }) {\n  return <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>;\n}\n\n\nexport default function PackingList() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Space suit\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={false} \n          name=\"Photo of Tam\" \n        />\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that some of the Item components have their isPacked prop set to true instead of false. You want to add a checkmark (✔) to packed items if isPacked={true}.\n\nYou can write this as an if/else statement like so:\n\nif (isPacked) {\n\n  return <li className=\"item\">{name} ✔</li>;\n\n}\n\nreturn <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>;\n\nIf the isPacked prop is true, this code returns a different JSX tree. With this change, some of the items get a checkmark at the end:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Item({ name, isPacked }) {\n  if (isPacked) {\n    return <li className=\"item\">{name} ✔</li>;\n  }\n  return <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>;\n}\n\nexport default function PackingList() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Space suit\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={false} \n          name=\"Photo of Tam\" \n        />\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTry editing what gets returned in either case, and see how the result changes!\n\nNotice how you’re creating branching logic with JavaScript’s if and return statements. In React, control flow (like conditions) is handled by JavaScript.\n\nConditionally returning nothing with null \n\nIn some situations, you won’t want to render anything at all. For example, say you don’t want to show packed items at all. A component must return something. In this case, you can return null:\n\nif (isPacked) {\n\n  return null;\n\n}\n\nreturn <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>;\n\nIf isPacked is true, the component will return nothing, null. Otherwise, it will return JSX to render.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Item({ name, isPacked }) {\n  if (isPacked) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  return <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>;\n}\n\nexport default function PackingList() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Space suit\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={false} \n          name=\"Photo of Tam\" \n        />\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn practice, returning null from a component isn’t common because it might surprise a developer trying to render it. More often, you would conditionally include or exclude the component in the parent component’s JSX. Here’s how to do that!\n\nConditionally including JSX \n\nIn the previous example, you controlled which (if any!) JSX tree would be returned by the component. You may already have noticed some duplication in the render output:\n\n<li className=\"item\">{name} ✔</li>\n\nis very similar to\n\n<li className=\"item\">{name}</li>\n\nBoth of the conditional branches return <li className=\"item\">...</li>:\n\nif (isPacked) {\n\n  return <li className=\"item\">{name} ✔</li>;\n\n}\n\nreturn <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>;\n\nWhile this duplication isn’t harmful, it could make your code harder to maintain. What if you want to change the className? You’d have to do it in two places in your code! In such a situation, you could conditionally include a little JSX to make your code more DRY.\n\nConditional (ternary) operator (? :) \n\nJavaScript has a compact syntax for writing a conditional expression — the conditional operator or “ternary operator”.\n\nInstead of this:\n\nif (isPacked) {\n\n  return <li className=\"item\">{name} ✔</li>;\n\n}\n\nreturn <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>;\n\nYou can write this:\n\nreturn (\n\n  <li className=\"item\">\n\n    {isPacked ? name + ' ✔' : name}\n\n  </li>\n\n);\n\nYou can read it as “if isPacked is true, then (?) render name + ' ✔', otherwise (:) render name”.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nAre these two examples fully equivalent? \nShow Details\n\nNow let’s say you want to wrap the completed item’s text into another HTML tag, like <del> to strike it out. You can add even more newlines and parentheses so that it’s easier to nest more JSX in each of the cases:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Item({ name, isPacked }) {\n  return (\n    <li className=\"item\">\n      {isPacked ? (\n        <del>\n          {name + ' ✔'}\n        </del>\n      ) : (\n        name\n      )}\n    </li>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function PackingList() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Space suit\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={false} \n          name=\"Photo of Tam\" \n        />\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis style works well for simple conditions, but use it in moderation. If your components get messy with too much nested conditional markup, consider extracting child components to clean things up. In React, markup is a part of your code, so you can use tools like variables and functions to tidy up complex expressions.\n\nLogical AND operator (&&) \n\nAnother common shortcut you’ll encounter is the JavaScript logical AND (&&) operator. Inside React components, it often comes up when you want to render some JSX when the condition is true, or render nothing otherwise. With &&, you could conditionally render the checkmark only if isPacked is true:\n\nreturn (\n\n  <li className=\"item\">\n\n    {name} {isPacked && '✔'}\n\n  </li>\n\n);\n\nYou can read this as “if isPacked, then (&&) render the checkmark, otherwise, render nothing”.\n\nHere it is in action:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Item({ name, isPacked }) {\n  return (\n    <li className=\"item\">\n      {name} {isPacked && '✔'}\n    </li>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function PackingList() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Space suit\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={false} \n          name=\"Photo of Tam\" \n        />\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA JavaScript && expression returns the value of its right side (in our case, the checkmark) if the left side (our condition) is true. But if the condition is false, the whole expression becomes false. React considers false as a “hole” in the JSX tree, just like null or undefined, and doesn’t render anything in its place.\n\nPitfall\n\nDon’t put numbers on the left side of &&.\n\nTo test the condition, JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is 0, then the whole expression gets that value (0), and React will happily render 0 rather than nothing.\n\nFor example, a common mistake is to write code like messageCount && <p>New messages</p>. It’s easy to assume that it renders nothing when messageCount is 0, but it really renders the 0 itself!\n\nTo fix it, make the left side a boolean: messageCount > 0 && <p>New messages</p>.\n\nConditionally assigning JSX to a variable \n\nWhen the shortcuts get in the way of writing plain code, try using an if statement and a variable. You can reassign variables defined with let, so start by providing the default content you want to display, the name:\n\nlet itemContent = name;\n\nUse an if statement to reassign a JSX expression to itemContent if isPacked is true:\n\nif (isPacked) {\n\n  itemContent = name + \" ✔\";\n\n}\n\nCurly braces open the “window into JavaScript”. Embed the variable with curly braces in the returned JSX tree, nesting the previously calculated expression inside of JSX:\n\n<li className=\"item\">\n\n  {itemContent}\n\n</li>\n\nThis style is the most verbose, but it’s also the most flexible. Here it is in action:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Item({ name, isPacked }) {\n  let itemContent = name;\n  if (isPacked) {\n    itemContent = name + \" ✔\";\n  }\n  return (\n    <li className=\"item\">\n      {itemContent}\n    </li>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function PackingList() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Space suit\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={false} \n          name=\"Photo of Tam\" \n        />\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nLike before, this works not only for text, but for arbitrary JSX too:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Item({ name, isPacked }) {\n  let itemContent = name;\n  if (isPacked) {\n    itemContent = (\n      <del>\n        {name + \" ✔\"}\n      </del>\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <li className=\"item\">\n      {itemContent}\n    </li>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function PackingList() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Space suit\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={true} \n          name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" \n        />\n        <Item \n          isPacked={false} \n          name=\"Photo of Tam\" \n        />\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you’re not familiar with JavaScript, this variety of styles might seem overwhelming at first.

You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data. On this page, you’ll use filter() and map() with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to render components from an array using JavaScript’s map()\nHow to render only specific components using JavaScript’s filter()\nWhen and why to use React keys\nRendering data from arrays \n\nSay that you have a list of content.\n\n<ul>\n\n  <li>Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician</li>\n\n  <li>Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist</li>\n\n  <li>Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist</li>\n\n  <li>Percy Lavon Julian: chemist</li>\n\n  <li>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe only difference among those list items is their contents, their data. You will often need to show several instances of the same component using different data when building interfaces: from lists of comments to galleries of profile images. In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like map() and filter() to render lists of components from them.\n\nHere’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:\n\nMove the data into an array:\nconst people = [\n\n  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',\n\n  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',\n\n  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',\n\n  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',\n\n  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'\n\n];\nMap the people members into a new array of JSX nodes, listItems:\nconst listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>);\nReturn listItems from your component wrapped in a <ul>:\nreturn <ul>{listItems}</ul>;\n\nHere is the result:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nconst people = [\n  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',\n  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',\n  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',\n  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',\n  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'\n];\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const listItems = people.map(person =>\n    <li>{person}</li>\n  );\n  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;\n}\n\n\n\nNotice the sandbox above displays a console error:\n\nConsole\nWarning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.\n\nYou’ll learn how to fix this error later on this page. Before we get to that, let’s add some structure to your data.\n\nFiltering arrays of items \n\nThis data can be structured even more.\n\nconst people = [{\n\n  id: 0,\n\n  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',\n\n  profession: 'mathematician',\n\n}, {\n\n  id: 1,\n\n  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',\n\n  profession: 'chemist',\n\n}, {\n\n  id: 2,\n\n  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',\n\n  profession: 'physicist',\n\n}, {\n\n  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',\n\n  profession: 'chemist',  \n\n}, {\n\n  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',\n\n  profession: 'astrophysicist',\n\n}];\n\nLet’s say you want a way to only show people whose profession is 'chemist'. You can use JavaScript’s filter() method to return just those people. This method takes an array of items, passes them through a “test” (a function that returns true or false), and returns a new array of only those items that passed the test (returned true).\n\nYou only want the items where profession is 'chemist'. The “test” function for this looks like (person) => person.profession === 'chemist'. Here’s how to put it together:\n\nCreate a new array of just “chemist” people, chemists, by calling filter() on the people filtering by person.profession === 'chemist':\nconst chemists = people.filter(person =>\n\n  person.profession === 'chemist'\n\n);\nNow map over chemists:\nconst listItems = chemists.map(person =>\n\n  <li>\n\n     <img\n\n       src={getImageUrl(person)}\n\n       alt={person.name}\n\n     />\n\n     <p>\n\n       <b>{person.name}:</b>\n\n       {' ' + person.profession + ' '}\n\n       known for {person.accomplishment}\n\n     </p>\n\n  </li>\n\n);\nLastly, return the listItems from your component:\nreturn <ul>{listItems}</ul>;\nApp.js\ndata.js\nutils.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { people } from './data.js';\nimport { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const chemists = people.filter(person =>\n    person.profession === 'chemist'\n  );\n  const listItems = chemists.map(person =>\n    <li>\n      <img\n        src={getImageUrl(person)}\n        alt={person.name}\n      />\n      <p>\n        <b>{person.name}:</b>\n        {' ' + person.profession + ' '}\n        known for {person.accomplishment}\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  );\n  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nArrow functions implicitly return the expression right after =>, so you didn’t need a return statement:\n\nconst listItems = chemists.map(person =>\n\n  <li>...</li> // Implicit return!\n\n);\n\nHowever, you must write return explicitly if your => is followed by a { curly brace!\n\nconst listItems = chemists.map(person => { // Curly brace\n\n  return <li>...</li>;\n\n});\n\nArrow functions containing => { are said to have a “block body”. They let you write more than a single line of code, but you have to write a return statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned!\n\nKeeping list items in order with key \n\nNotice that all the sandboxes above show an error in the console:\n\nConsole\nWarning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.\n\nYou need to give each array item a key — a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:\n\n<li key={person.id}>...</li>\nNote\n\nJSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys!\n\nKeys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.\n\nRather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data:\n\nApp.js\ndata.js\nutils.js\nReset\nFork\nexport const people = [{\n  id: 0, // Used in JSX as a key\n  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',\n  profession: 'mathematician',\n  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',\n  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'\n}, {\n  id: 1, // Used in JSX as a key\n  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',\n  profession: 'chemist',\n  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',\n  imageId: 'mynHUSa'\n}, {\n  id: 2, // Used in JSX as a key\n  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',\n  profession: 'physicist',\n  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',\n  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'\n}, {\n  id: 3, // Used in JSX as a key\n  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',\n  profession: 'chemist',\n  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',\n  imageId: 'IOjWm71'\n}, {\n  id: 4, // Used in JSX as a key\n  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',\n  profession: 'astrophysicist',\n  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',\n  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'\n}];\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nDisplaying several DOM nodes for each list item \nShow Details\nWhere to get your key \n\nDifferent sources of data provide different sources of keys:\n\nData from a database: If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.\nLocally generated data: If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an incrementing counter, crypto.randomUUID() or a package like uuid when creating items.\nRules of keys \nKeys must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.\nKeys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.\nWhy does React need keys? \n\nImagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names. Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.\n\nFile names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.\n\nPitfall\n\nYou might be tempted to use an item’s index in the array as its key. In fact, that’s what React will use if you don’t specify a key at all. But the order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or if the array gets reordered. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs.\n\nSimilarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with key={Math.random()}. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.\n\nNote that your components won’t receive key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: <Profile key={id} userId={id} />.\n\nRecap\n\nOn this page you learned:\n\nHow to move data out of components and into data structures like arrays and objects.\nHow to generate sets of similar components with JavaScript’s map().\nHow to create arrays of filtered items with JavaScript’s filter().\nWhy and how to set key on each component in a collection so React can keep track of each of them even if their position or data changes.\nTry out some challenges\n1.

Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to pass props to a component\nHow to read props from a component\nHow to specify default values for props\nHow to pass some JSX to a component\nHow props change over time\nFamiliar props \n\nProps are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, className, src, alt, width, and height are some of the props you can pass to an <img>:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nfunction Avatar() {\n  return (\n    <img\n      className=\"avatar\"\n      src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg\"\n      alt=\"Lin Lanying\"\n      width={100}\n      height={100}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n  return (\n    <Avatar />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe props you can pass to an <img> tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to the HTML standard). But you can pass any props to your own components, such as <Avatar>, to customize them. Here’s how!\n\nPassing props to a component \n\nIn this code, the Profile component isn’t passing any props to its child component, Avatar:\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Avatar />\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou can give Avatar some props in two steps.\n\nStep 1: Pass props to the child component \n\nFirst, pass some props to Avatar. For example, let’s pass two props: person (an object), and size (a number):\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Avatar\n\n      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}\n\n      size={100}\n\n    />\n\n  );\n\n}\nNote\n\nIf double curly braces after person= confuse you, recall they’re merely an object inside the JSX curlies.\n\nNow you can read these props inside the Avatar component.\n\nStep 2: Read props inside the child component \n\nYou can read these props by listing their names person, size separated by the commas inside ({ and }) directly after function Avatar. This lets you use them inside the Avatar code, like you would with a variable.\n\nfunction Avatar({ person, size }) {\n\n  // person and size are available here\n\n}\n\nAdd some logic to Avatar that uses the person and size props for rendering, and you’re done.\n\nNow you can configure Avatar to render in many different ways with different props. Try tweaking the values!\n\nApp.js\nutils.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';\n\nfunction Avatar({ person, size }) {\n  return (\n    <img\n      className=\"avatar\"\n      src={getImageUrl(person)}\n      alt={person.name}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Avatar\n        size={100}\n        person={{ \n          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi', \n          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'\n        }}\n      />\n      <Avatar\n        size={80}\n        person={{\n          name: 'Aklilu Lemma', \n          imageId: 'OKS67lh'\n        }}\n      />\n      <Avatar\n        size={50}\n        person={{ \n          name: 'Lin Lanying',\n          imageId: '1bX5QH6'\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nProps let you think about parent and child components independently. For example, you can change the person or the size props inside Profile without having to think about how Avatar uses them. Similarly, you can change how the Avatar uses these props, without looking at the Profile.\n\nYou can think of props like “knobs” that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions—in fact, props are the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a props object:\n\nfunction Avatar(props) {\n\n  let person = props.person;\n\n  let size = props.size;\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nUsually you don’t need the whole props object itself, so you destructure it into individual props.\n\nPitfall\n\nDon’t miss the pair of { and } curlies inside of ( and ) when declaring props:\n\nfunction Avatar({ person, size }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis syntax is called “destructuring” and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter:\n\nfunction Avatar(props) {\n\n  let person = props.person;\n\n  let size = props.size;\n\n  // ...\n\n}\nSpecifying a default value for a prop \n\nIf you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the destructuring by putting = and the default value right after the parameter:\n\nfunction Avatar({ person, size = 100 }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow, if <Avatar person={...} /> is rendered with no size prop, the size will be set to 100.\n\nThe default value is only used if the size prop is missing or if you pass size={undefined}. But if you pass size={null} or size={0}, the default value will not be used.\n\nForwarding props with the JSX spread syntax \n\nSometimes, passing props gets very repetitive:\n\nfunction Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"card\">\n\n      <Avatar\n\n        person={person}\n\n        size={size}\n\n        isSepia={isSepia}\n\n        thickBorder={thickBorder}\n\n      />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with repetitive code—it can be more legible. But at times you may value conciseness. Some components forward all of their props to their children, like how this Profile does with Avatar. Because they don’t use any of their props directly, it can make sense to use a more concise “spread” syntax:\n\nfunction Profile(props) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"card\">\n\n      <Avatar {...props} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis forwards all of Profile’s props to the Avatar without listing each of their names.\n\nUse spread syntax with restraint. If you’re using it in every other component, something is wrong. Often, it indicates that you should split your components and pass children as JSX. More on that next!\n\nPassing JSX as children \n\nIt is common to nest built-in browser tags:\n\n<div>\n\n  <img />\n\n</div>\n\nSometimes you’ll want to nest your own components the same way:\n\n<Card>\n\n  <Avatar />\n\n</Card>\n\nWhen you nest content inside a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called children. For example, the Card component below will receive a children prop set to <Avatar /> and render it in a wrapper div:\n\nApp.js\nAvatar.js\nutils.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Avatar from './Avatar.js';\n\nfunction Card({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"card\">\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Avatar\n        size={100}\n        person={{ \n          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',\n          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'\n        }}\n      />\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTry replacing the <Avatar> inside <Card> with some text to see how the Card component can wrap any nested content. It doesn’t need to “know” what’s being rendered inside of it. You will see this flexible pattern in many places.\n\nYou can think of a component with a children prop as having a “hole” that can be “filled in” by its parent components with arbitrary JSX. You will often use the children prop for visual wrappers: panels, grids, etc.\n\nIllustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors\n\nHow props change over time \n\nThe Clock component below receives two props from its parent component: color and time. (The parent component’s code is omitted because it uses state, which we won’t dive into just yet.)\n\nTry changing the color in the select box below:\n\nClock.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Clock({ color, time }) {\n  return (\n    <h1 style={{ color: color }}>\n      {time}\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates that a component may receive different props over time. Props are not always static! Here, the time prop changes every second, and the color prop changes when you select another color. Props reflect a component’s data at any point in time, rather than only in the beginning.\n\nHowever, props are immutable—a term from computer science meaning “unchangeable”. When a component needs to change its props (for example, in response to a user interaction or new data), it will have to “ask” its parent component to pass it different props—a new object! Its old props will then be cast aside, and eventually the JavaScript engine will reclaim the memory taken by them.\n\nDon’t try to “change props”. When you need to respond to the user input (like changing the selected color), you will need to “set state”, which you can learn about in State: A Component’s Memory.\n\nRecap\nTo pass props, add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML attributes.\nTo read props, use the function Avatar({ person, size }) destructuring syntax.\nYou can specify a default value like size = 100, which is used for missing and undefined props.\nYou can forward all props with <Avatar {...props} /> JSX spread syntax, but don’t overuse it!\nNested JSX like <Card><Avatar /></Card> will appear as Card component’s children prop.\nProps are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props.\nYou can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set state.\nTry out some challenges\n1. Extract a component\n2. Adjust the image size based on a prop\n3.

    "html": "DESCRIBING THE UI\nJavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces\n\nJSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to pass strings with quotes\nHow to reference a JavaScript variable inside JSX with curly braces\nHow to call a JavaScript function inside JSX with curly braces\nHow to use a JavaScript object inside JSX with curly braces\nPassing strings with quotes \n\nWhen you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nexport default function Avatar() {\n  return (\n    <img\n      className=\"avatar\"\n      src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg\"\n      alt=\"Gregorio Y. Zara\"\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nHere, \"https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg\" and \"Gregorio Y. Zara\" are being passed as strings.\n\nBut what if you want to dynamically specify the src or alt text? You could use a value from JavaScript by replacing \" and \" with { and }:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Avatar() {\n  const avatar = 'https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg';\n  const description = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';\n  return (\n    <img\n      className=\"avatar\"\n      src={avatar}\n      alt={description}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nNotice the difference between className=\"avatar\", which specifies an \"avatar\" CSS class name that makes the image round, and src={avatar} that reads the value of the JavaScript variable called avatar. That’s because curly braces let you work with JavaScript right there in your markup!\n\nUsing curly braces: A window into the JavaScript world \n\nJSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it’s possible to use JavaScript inside it—with curly braces { }. The example below first declares a name for the scientist, name, then embeds it with curly braces inside the <h1>:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  const name = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';\n  return (\n    <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nTry changing the name’s value from 'Gregorio Y. Zara' to 'Hedy Lamarr'. See how the list title changes?\n\nAny JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like formatDate():\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nconst today = new Date();\n\nfunction formatDate(date) {\n  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat(\n    'en-US',\n    { weekday: 'long' }\n  ).format(date);\n}\n\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  return (\n    <h1>To Do List for {formatDate(today)}</h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\nWhere to use curly braces \n\nYou can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:\n\nAs text directly inside a JSX tag: <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1> works, but <{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}> will not.\nAs attributes immediately following the = sign: src={avatar} will read the avatar variable, but src=\"{avatar}\" will pass the string \"{avatar}\".\nUsing “double curlies”: CSS and other objects in JSX \n\nIn addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like { name: \"Hedy Lamarr\", inventions: 5 }. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: person={{ name: \"Hedy Lamarr\", inventions: 5 }}.\n\nYou may see this with inline CSS styles in JSX. React does not require you to use inline styles (CSS classes work great for most cases). But when you need an inline style, you pass an object to the style attribute:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  return (\n    <ul style={{\n      backgroundColor: 'black',\n      color: 'pink'\n    }}>\n      <li>Improve the videophone</li>\n      <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>\n      <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nTry changing the values of backgroundColor and color.\n\nYou can really see the JavaScript object inside the curly braces when you write it like this:\n\n<ul style={\n\n  {\n\n    backgroundColor: 'black',\n\n    color: 'pink'\n\n  }\n\n}>\n\nThe next time you see {{ and }} in JSX, know that it’s nothing more than an object inside the JSX curlies!\n\nPitfall\n\nInline style properties are written in camelCase. For example, HTML <ul style=\"background-color: black\"> would be written as <ul style={{ backgroundColor: 'black' }}>  in your component.\n\nMore fun with JavaScript objects and curly braces \n\nYou can move several expressions into one object, and reference them in your JSX inside curly braces:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nconst person = {\n  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',\n  theme: {\n    backgroundColor: 'black',\n    color: 'pink'\n  }\n};\n\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  return (\n    <div style={person.theme}>\n      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>\n      <img\n        className=\"avatar\"\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Gregorio Y.

    "url": "https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx",
    "html": "DESCRIBING THE UI\nWriting Markup with JSX\n\nJSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.\n\nYou will learn\nWhy React mixes markup with rendering logic\nHow JSX is different from HTML\nHow to display information with JSX\nJSX: Putting markup into JavaScript \n\nThe Web has been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For many years, web developers kept content in HTML, design in CSS, and logic in JavaScript—often in separate files! Content was marked up inside HTML while the page’s logic lived separately in JavaScript:\n\nHTML\n\nJavaScript\n\nBut as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components.\n\nSidebar.js React component\n\nForm.js React component\n\nKeeping a button’s rendering logic and markup together ensures that they stay in sync with each other on every edit. Conversely, details that are unrelated, such as the button’s markup and a sidebar’s markup, are isolated from each other, making it safer to change either of them on their own.\n\nEach React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information. The best way to understand this is to convert some HTML markup to JSX markup.\n\nNote\n\nJSX and React are two separate things. They’re often used together, but you can use them independently of each other. JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library.\n\nConverting HTML to JSX \n\nSuppose that you have some (perfectly valid) HTML:\n\n<h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>\n\n<img \n\n  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg\" \n\n  alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" \n\n  class=\"photo\"\n\n>\n\n<ul>\n\n    <li>Invent new traffic lights\n\n    <li>Rehearse a movie scene\n\n    <li>Improve the spectrum technology\n\n</ul>\n\nAnd you want to put it into your component:\n\nexport default function TodoList() {\n\n  return (\n\n    // ???\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nIf you copy and paste it as is, it will not work:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  return (\n    // This doesn't quite work!\n    <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>\n    <img \n      src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg\" \n      alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" \n      class=\"photo\"\n    >\n    <ul>\n      <li>Invent new traffic lights\n      <li>Rehearse a movie scene\n      <li>Improve the spectrum technology\n    </ul>\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is because JSX is stricter and has a few more rules than HTML! If you read the error messages above, they’ll guide you to fix the markup, or you can follow the guide below.\n\nNote\n\nMost of the time, React’s on-screen error messages will help you find where the problem is. Give them a read if you get stuck!\n\nThe Rules of JSX \n1. Return a single root element \n\nTo return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag.\n\nFor example, you can use a <div>:\n\n<div>\n\n  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>\n\n  <img \n\n    src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg\" \n\n    alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" \n\n    class=\"photo\"\n\n  >\n\n  <ul>\n\n    ...\n\n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\nIf you don’t want to add an extra <div> to your markup, you can write <> and </> instead:\n\n<>\n\n  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>\n\n  <img \n\n    src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg\" \n\n    alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" \n\n    class=\"photo\"\n\n  >\n\n  <ul>\n\n    ...\n\n  </ul>\n\n</>\n\nThis empty tag is called a Fragment. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy do multiple JSX tags need to be wrapped? \nShow Details\n2. Close all the tags \n\nJSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />, and wrapping tags like <li>oranges must be written as <li>oranges</li>.\n\nThis is how Hedy Lamarr’s image and list items look closed:\n\n<>\n\n  <img \n\n    src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg\" \n\n    alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" \n\n    class=\"photo\"\n\n   />\n\n  <ul>\n\n    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>\n\n    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>\n\n    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>\n\n  </ul>\n\n</>\n3. camelCase all most of the things! \n\nJSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like class.\n\nThis is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of stroke-width you use strokeWidth. Since class is a reserved word, in React you write className instead, named after the corresponding DOM property:\n\n<img \n\n  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg\" \n\n  alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" \n\n  className=\"photo\"\n\n/>\n\nYou can find all these attributes in the list of DOM component props. If you get one wrong, don’t worry—React will print a message with a possible correction to the browser console.\n\nPitfall\n\nFor historical reasons, aria-* and data-* attributes are written as in HTML with dashes.\n\nPro-tip: Use a JSX Converter \n\nConverting all these attributes in existing markup can be tedious! We recommend using a converter to translate your existing HTML and SVG to JSX. Converters are very useful in practice, but it’s still worth understanding what is going on so that you can comfortably write JSX on your own.\n\nHere is your final result:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>\n      <img \n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg\" \n        alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" \n        className=\"photo\" \n      />\n      <ul>\n        <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>\n        <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>\n        <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nRecap\n\nNow you know why JSX exists and how to use it in components:\n\nReact components group rendering logic together with markup because they are related.\nJSX is similar to HTML, with a few differences. You can use a converter if you need to.\nError messages will often point you in the right direction to fixing your markup.\nTry out some challenges\nChallenge 1 of 1: Convert some HTML to JSX \n\nThis HTML was pasted into a component, but it’s not valid JSX.

Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page.\n\nExporting and importing a component \n\nWhat if you want to change the landing screen in the future and put a list of science books there? Or place all the profiles somewhere else? It makes sense to move Gallery and Profile out of the root component file. This will make them more modular and reusable in other files. You can move a component in three steps:\n\nMake a new JS file to put the components in.\nExport your function component from that file (using either default or named exports).\nImport it in the file where you’ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports).\n\nHere both Profile and Gallery have been moved out of App.js into a new file called Gallery.js. Now you can change App.js to import Gallery from Gallery.js:\n\nApp.js\nGallery.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Gallery from './Gallery.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Gallery />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nNotice how this example is broken down into two component files now:\n\nGallery.js:\nDefines the Profile component which is only used within the same file and is not exported.\nExports the Gallery component as a default export.\nApp.js:\nImports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.\nExports the root App component as a default export.\nNote\n\nYou may encounter files that leave off the .js file extension like so:\n\nimport Gallery from './Gallery';\n\nEither './Gallery.js' or './Gallery' will work with React, though the former is closer to how native ES Modules work.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nDefault vs named exports \nShow Details\nExporting and importing multiple components from the same file \n\nWhat if you want to show just one Profile instead of a gallery? You can export the Profile component, too. But Gallery.js already has a default export, and you can’t have two default exports. You could create a new file with a default export, or you could add a named export for Profile. A file can only have one default export, but it can have numerous named exports!\n\nNote\n\nTo reduce the potential confusion between default and named exports, some teams choose to only stick to one style (default or named), or avoid mixing them in a single file. Do what works best for you!\n\nFirst, export Profile from Gallery.js using a named export (no default keyword):\n\nexport function Profile() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThen, import Profile from Gallery.js to App.js using a named import (with the curly braces):\n\nimport { Profile } from './Gallery.js';\n\nFinally, render <Profile /> from the App component:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return <Profile />;\n\n}\n\nNow Gallery.js contains two exports: a default Gallery export, and a named Profile export. App.js imports both of them. Try editing <Profile /> to <Gallery /> and back in this example:\n\nApp.js\nGallery.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Gallery from './Gallery.js';\nimport { Profile } from './Gallery.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Profile />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nNow you’re using a mix of default and named exports:\n\nGallery.js:\nExports the Profile component as a named export called Profile.\nExports the Gallery component as a default export.\nApp.js:\nImports Profile as a named import called Profile from Gallery.js.\nImports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.\nExports the root App component as a default export.\nRecap\n\nOn this page you learned:\n\nWhat a root component file is\nHow to import and export a component\nWhen and how to use default and named imports and exports\nHow to export multiple components from the same file\nTry out some challenges\nChallenge 1 of 1: Split the components further \n\nCurrently, Gallery.js exports both Profile and Gallery, which is a bit confusing.\n\nMove the Profile component to its own Profile.js, and then change the App component to render both <Profile /> and <Gallery /> one after another.\n\nYou may use either a default or a named export for Profile, but make sure that you use the corresponding import syntax in both App.js and Gallery.js!

    "html": "DESCRIBING THE UI\nYour First Component\n\nComponents are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!\n\nYou will learn\nWhat a component is\nWhat role components play in a React application\nHow to write your first React component\nComponents: UI building blocks \n\nOn the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like <h1> and <li>:\n\n<article>\n\n  <h1>My First Component</h1>\n\n  <ol>\n\n    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>\n\n    <li>Defining a Component</li>\n\n    <li>Using a Component</li>\n\n  </ol>\n\n</article>\n\nThis markup represents this article <article>, its heading <h1>, and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list <ol>. Markup like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown—every piece of UI you see on the Web.\n\nReact lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”, reusable UI elements for your app. The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a <TableOfContents /> component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like <article>, <h1>, etc.\n\nJust like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. For example, the documentation page you’re reading is made out of React components:\n\n<PageLayout>\n\n  <NavigationHeader>\n\n    <SearchBar />\n\n    <Link to=\"/docs\">Docs</Link>\n\n  </NavigationHeader>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n  <PageContent>\n\n    <TableOfContents />\n\n    <DocumentationText />\n\n  </PageContent>\n\n</PageLayout>\n\nAs your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. Our table of contents above could be added to any screen with <TableOfContents />! You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like Chakra UI and Material UI.\n\nDefining a component \n\nTraditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the example below):\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Profile() {\n  return (\n    <img\n      src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg\"\n      alt=\"Katherine Johnson\"\n    />\n  )\n}\n\n\n\nAnd here’s how to build a component:\n\nStep 1: Export the component \n\nThe export default prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files. (More on importing in Importing and Exporting Components!)\n\nStep 2: Define the function \n\nWith function Profile() { } you define a JavaScript function with the name Profile.\n\nPitfall\n\nReact components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won’t work!\n\nStep 3: Add markup \n\nThe component returns an <img /> tag with src and alt attributes. <img /> is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called JSX, and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.\n\nReturn statements can be written all on one line, as in this component:\n\nreturn <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" />;\n\nBut if your markup isn’t all on the same line as the return keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses:\n\nreturn (\n\n  <div>\n\n    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" />\n\n  </div>\n\n);\nPitfall\n\nWithout parentheses, any code on the lines after return will be ignored!\n\nUsing a component \n\nNow that you’ve defined your Profile component, you can nest it inside other components. For example, you can export a Gallery component that uses multiple Profile components:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Profile() {\n  return (\n    <img\n      src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg\"\n      alt=\"Katherine Johnson\"\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Gallery() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>\n      <Profile />\n      <Profile />\n      <Profile />\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nWhat the browser sees \n\nNotice the difference in casing:\n\n<section> is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag.\n<Profile /> starts with a capital P, so React knows that we want to use our component called Profile.\n\nAnd Profile contains even more HTML: <img />. In the end, this is what the browser sees:\n\n<section>\n\n  <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>\n\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" />\n\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" />\n\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" />\n\n</section>\nNesting and organizing components \n\nComponents are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move Profile to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the page about imports.\n\nBecause the Profile components are rendered inside Gallery—even several times!—we can say that Gallery is a parent component, rendering each Profile as a “child”. This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.\n\nPitfall\n\nComponents can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions:\n\nexport default function Gallery() {\n\n  // 🔴 Never define a component inside another component!\n\n  function Profile() {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe snippet above is very slow and causes bugs. Instead, define every component at the top level:\n\nexport default function Gallery() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\n// ✅ Declare components at the top level\n\nfunction Profile() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhen a child component needs some data from a parent, pass it by props instead of nesting definitions.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nComponents all the way down \nShow Details\nRecap\n\nYou’ve just gotten your first taste of React! Let’s recap some key points.\n\nReact lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.\n\nIn a React app, every piece of UI is a component.\n\nReact components are regular JavaScript functions except:\n\nTheir names always begin with a capital letter.\nThey return JSX markup.\nTry out some challenges\n1.

Components with no child components are leaf components. This categorization of components is useful for understanding data flow and rendering performance.\n\nModelling the relationship between JavaScript modules is another useful way to understand your app. We refer to it as a module dependency tree.\n\nAn example module dependency tree.\n\nA dependency tree is often used by build tools to bundle all the relevant JavaScript code for the client to download and render.

    "html": "INSTALLATION\nUsing TypeScript\n\nTypeScript is a popular way to add type definitions to JavaScript codebases. Out of the box, TypeScript supports JSX and you can get full React Web support by adding @types/react and @types/react-dom to your project.\n\nYou will learn\nTypeScript with React Components\nExamples of typing with Hooks\nCommon types from @types/react\nFurther learning locations\nInstallation \n\nAll production-grade React frameworks offer support for using TypeScript. Follow the framework specific guide for installation:\n\nNext.js\nRemix\nGatsby\nExpo\nAdding TypeScript to an existing React project \n\nTo install the latest version of React’s type definitions:\n\n Terminal\n Copy\nnpm install @types/react @types/react-dom\n\nThe following compiler options need to be set in your tsconfig.json:\n\ndom must be included in lib (Note: If no lib option is specified, dom is included by default).\njsx must be set to one of the valid options. preserve should suffice for most applications. If you’re publishing a library, consult the jsx documentation on what value to choose.\nTypeScript with React Components \nNote\n\nEvery file containing JSX must use the .tsx file extension. This is a TypeScript-specific extension that tells TypeScript that this file contains JSX.\n\nWriting TypeScript with React is very similar to writing JavaScript with React. The key difference when working with a component is that you can provide types for your component’s props. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors.\n\nTaking the MyButton component from the Quick Start guide, we can add a type describing the title for the button:\n\nApp.tsx\nReset\nFork\nTypeScript Playground\nfunction MyButton({ title }: { title: string }) {\n  return (\n    <button>{title}</button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n      <MyButton title=\"I'm a button\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNote\n\nThese sandboxes can handle TypeScript code, but they do not run the type-checker. This means you can amend the TypeScript sandboxes to learn, but you won’t get any type errors or warnings. To get type-checking, you can use the TypeScript Playground or use a more fully-featured online sandbox.\n\nThis inline syntax is the simplest way to provide types for a component, though once you start to have a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an interface or type to describe the component’s props:\n\nApp.tsx\nReset\nFork\nTypeScript Playground\ninterface MyButtonProps {\n  /** The text to display inside the button */\n  title: string;\n  /** Whether the button can be interacted with */\n  disabled: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction MyButton({ title, disabled }: MyButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <button disabled={disabled}>{title}</button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n      <MyButton title=\"I'm a disabled button\" disabled={true}/>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe type describing your component’s props can be as simple or as complex as you need, though they should be an object type described with either a type or interface. You can learn about how TypeScript describes objects in Object Types but you may also be interested in using Union Types to describe a prop that can be one of a few different types and the Creating Types from Types guide for more advanced use cases.\n\nExample Hooks \n\nThe type definitions from @types/react include types for the built-in Hooks, so you can use them in your components without any additional setup. They are built to take into account the code you write in your component, so you will get inferred types a lot of the time and ideally do not need to handle the minutiae of providing the types.\n\nHowever, we can look at a few examples of how to provide types for Hooks.\n\nuseState \n\nThe useState Hook will re-use the value passed in as the initial state to determine what the type of the value should be. For example:\n\n// Infer the type as \"boolean\"\n\nconst [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);\n\nWill assign the type of boolean to enabled, and setEnabled will be a function accepting either a boolean argument, or a function that returns a boolean. If you want to explicitly provide a type for the state, you can do so by providing a type argument to the useState call:\n\n// Explicitly set the type to \"boolean\"\n\nconst [enabled, setEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);\n\nThis isn’t very useful in this case, but a common case where you may want to provide a type is when you have a union type. For example, status here can be one of a few different strings:\n\ntype Status = \"idle\" | \"loading\" | \"success\" | \"error\";\n\n\n\nconst [status, setStatus] = useState<Status>(\"idle\");\n\nOr, as recommended in Principles for structuring state, you can group related state as an object and describe the different possibilities via object types:\n\ntype RequestState =\n\n  | { status: 'idle' }\n\n  | { status: 'loading' }\n\n  | { status: 'success', data: any }\n\n  | { status: 'error', error: Error };\n\n\n\nconst [requestState, setRequestState] = useState<RequestState>({ status: 'idle' });\nuseReducer \n\nThe useReducer Hook is a more complex Hook that takes a reducer function and an initial state. The types for the reducer function are inferred from the initial state. You can optionally provide a type argument to the useReducer call to provide a type for the state, but it is often better to set the type on the initial state instead:\n\nApp.tsx\nReset\nFork\nTypeScript Playground\nimport {useReducer} from 'react';\n\ninterface State {\n   count: number \n};\n\ntype CounterAction =\n  | { type: \"reset\" }\n  | { type: \"setCount\"; value: State[\"count\"] }\n\nconst initialState: State = { count: 0 };\n\nfunction stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case \"reset\":\n      return initialState;\n    case \"setCount\":\n      return { ...state, count: action.value };\n    default:\n      throw new Error(\"Unknown action\");\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(stateReducer, initialState);\n\n  const addFive = () => dispatch({ type: \"setCount\", value: state.count + 5 });\n  const reset = () => dispatch({ type: \"reset\" });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my counter</h1>\n\n      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>\n      <button onClick={addFive}>Add 5</button>\n      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWe are using TypeScript in a few key places:\n\ninterface State describes the shape of the reducer’s state.\ntype CounterAction describes the different actions which can be dispatched to the reducer.\nconst initialState: State provides a type for the initial state, and also the type which is used by useReducer by default.\nstateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State sets the types for the reducer function’s arguments and return value.\n\nA more explicit alternative to setting the type on initialState is to provide a type argument to useReducer:\n\nimport { stateReducer, State } from './your-reducer-implementation';\n\n\n\nconst initialState = { count: 0 };\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer<State>(stateReducer, initialState);\n\n}\nuseContext \n\nThe useContext Hook is a technique for passing data down the component tree without having to pass props through components. It is used by creating a provider component and often by creating a Hook to consume the value in a child component.\n\nThe type of the value provided by the context is inferred from the value passed to the createContext call:\n\nApp.tsx\nReset\nFork\nTypeScript Playground\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\ntype Theme = \"light\" | \"dark\" | \"system\";\nconst ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>(\"system\");\n\nconst useGetTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>('light');\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>\n      <MyComponent />\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const theme = useGetTheme();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis technique works when you have a default value which makes sense - but there are occasionally cases when you do not, and in those cases null can feel reasonable as a default value. However, to allow the type-system to understand your code, you need to explicitly set ContextShape | null on the createContext.\n\nThis causes the issue that you need to eliminate the | null in the type for context consumers. Our recommendation is to have the Hook do a runtime check for it’s existence and throw an error when not present:\n\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState, useMemo } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// This is a simpler example, but you can imagine a more complex object here\n\ntype ComplexObject = {\n\n  kind: string\n\n};\n\n\n\n// The context is created with `| null` in the type, to accurately reflect the default value.\n\nconst Context = createContext<ComplexObject | null>(null);\n\n\n\n// The `| null` will be removed via the check in the Hook.\n\nconst useGetComplexObject = () => {\n\n  const object = useContext(Context);\n\n  if (!object) { throw new Error(\"useGetComplexObject must be used within a Provider\") }\n\n  return object;\n\n}\n\n\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n\n  const object = useMemo(() => ({ kind: \"complex\" }), []);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <Context.Provider value={object}>\n\n      <MyComponent />\n\n    </Context.Provider>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const object = useGetComplexObject();\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <p>Current object: {object.kind}</p>\n\n    </div>\n\n  )\n\n}\nuseMemo \n\nThe useMemo Hooks will create/re-access a memorized value from a function call, re-running the function only when dependencies passed as the 2nd parameter are changed. The result of calling the Hook is inferred from the return value from the function in the first parameter. You can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook.\n\n// The type of visibleTodos is inferred from the return value of filterTodos\n\nconst visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\nuseCallback \n\nThe useCallback provide a stable reference to a function as long as the dependencies passed into the second parameter are the same. Like useMemo, the function’s type is inferred from the return value of the function in the first parameter, and you can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook.\n\nconst handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n}, [todos]);\n\nWhen working in TypeScript strict mode useCallback requires adding types for the parameters in your callback. This is because the type of the callback is inferred from the return value of the function, and without parameters the type cannot be fully understood.\n\nDepending on your code-style preferences, you could use the *EventHandler functions from the React types to provide the type for the event handler at the same time as defining the callback:\n\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function Form() {\n\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(\"Change me\");\n\n\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback<React.ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement>>((event) => {\n\n    setValue(event.currentTarget.value);\n\n  }, [setValue])\n\n  \n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />\n\n      <p>Value: {value}</p>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nUseful Types \n\nThere is quite an expansive set of types which come from the @types/react package, it is worth a read when you feel comfortable with how React and TypeScript interact. You can find them in React’s folder in DefinitelyTyped. We will cover a few of the more common types here.\n\nDOM Events \n\nWhen working with DOM events in React, the type of the event can often be inferred from the event handler. However, when you want to extract a function to be passed to an event handler, you will need to explicitly set the type of the event.\n\nApp.tsx\nReset\nFork\nTypeScript Playground\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(\"Change me\");\n\n  function handleChange(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {\n    setValue(event.currentTarget.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />\n      <p>Value: {value}</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThere are many types of events provided in the React types - the full list can be found here which is based on the most popular events from the DOM.\n\nWhen determining the type you are looking for you can first look at the hover information for the event handler you are using, which will show the type of the event.\n\nIf you need to use an event that is not included in this list, you can use the React.SyntheticEvent type, which is the base type for all events.\n\nChildren \n\nThere are two common paths to describing the children of a component. The first is to use the React.ReactNode type, which is a union of all the possible types that can be passed as children in JSX:\n\ninterface ModalRendererProps {\n\n  title: string;\n\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n\n}\n\nThis is a very broad definition of children. The second is to use the React.ReactElement type, which is only JSX elements and not JavaScript primitives like strings or numbers:\n\ninterface ModalRendererProps {\n\n  title: string;\n\n  children: React.ReactElement;\n\n}\n\nNote, that you cannot use TypeScript to describe that the children are a certain type of JSX elements, so you cannot use the type-system to describe a component which only accepts <li> children.\n\nYou can see all an example of both React.ReactNode and React.ReactElement with the type-checker in this TypeScript playground.\n\nStyle Props \n\nWhen using inline styles in React, you can use React.CSSProperties to describe the object passed to the style prop. This type is a union of all the possible CSS properties, and is a good way to ensure you are passing valid CSS properties to the style prop, and to get auto-complete in your editor.\n\ninterface MyComponentProps {\n\n  style: React.CSSProperties;\n\n}\nFurther learning \n\nThis guide has covered the basics of using TypeScript with React, but there is a lot more to learn.\nIndividual API pages on the docs may contain more in-depth documentation on how to use them with TypeScript.\n\nWe recommend the following resources:\n\nThe TypeScript handbook is the official documentation for TypeScript, and covers most key language features.\n\nThe TypeScript release notes covers a each new features in-depth.\n\nReact TypeScript Cheatsheet is a community-maintained cheatsheet for using TypeScript with React, covering a lot of useful edge cases and providing more breadth than this document.\n\nTypeScript Community Discord is a great place to ask questions and get help with TypeScript and React issues.\n\nPREVIOUS\nEditor Setup\nNEXT\nReact Developer Tools"

    "html": "INSTALLATION\nAdd React to an Existing Project\n\nIf you want to add some interactivity to your existing project, you don’t have to rewrite it in React. Add React to your existing stack, and render interactive React components anywhere.\n\nNote\n\nYou need to install Node.js for local development. Although you can try React online or with a simple HTML page, realistically most JavaScript tooling you’ll want to use for development requires Node.js.\n\nUsing React for an entire subroute of your existing website \n\nLet’s say you have an existing web app at example.com built with another server technology (like Rails), and you want to implement all routes starting with example.com/some-app/ fully with React.\n\nHere’s how we recommend to set it up:\n\nBuild the React part of your app using one of the React-based frameworks.\nSpecify /some-app as the base path in your framework’s configuration (here’s how: Next.js, Gatsby).\nConfigure your server or a proxy so that all requests under /some-app/ are handled by your React app.\n\nThis ensures the React part of your app can benefit from the best practices baked into those frameworks.\n\nMany React-based frameworks are full-stack and let your React app take advantage of the server. However, you can use the same approach even if you can’t or don’t want to run JavaScript on the server. In that case, serve the HTML/CSS/JS export (next export output for Next.js, default for Gatsby) at /some-app/ instead.\n\nUsing React for a part of your existing page \n\nLet’s say you have an existing page built with another technology (either a server one like Rails, or a client one like Backbone), and you want to render interactive React components somewhere on that page. That’s a common way to integrate React—in fact, it’s how most React usage looked at Meta for many years!\n\nYou can do this in two steps:\n\nSet up a JavaScript environment that lets you use the JSX syntax, split your code into modules with the import / export syntax, and use packages (for example, React) from the npm package registry.\nRender your React components where you want to see them on the page.\n\nThe exact approach depends on your existing page setup, so let’s walk through some details.\n\nStep 1: Set up a modular JavaScript environment \n\nA modular JavaScript environment lets you write your React components in individual files, as opposed to writing all of your code in a single file. It also lets you use all the wonderful packages published by other developers on the npm registry—including React itself! How you do this depends on your existing setup:\n\nIf your app is already split into files that use import statements, try to use the setup you already have. Check whether writing <div /> in your JS code causes a syntax error. If it causes a syntax error, you might need to transform your JavaScript code with Babel, and enable the Babel React preset to use JSX.\n\nIf your app doesn’t have an existing setup for compiling JavaScript modules, set it up with Vite. The Vite community maintains many integrations with backend frameworks, including Rails, Django, and Laravel. If your backend framework is not listed, follow this guide to manually integrate Vite builds with your backend.\n\nTo check whether your setup works, run this command in your project folder:\n\n Terminal\n Copy\nnpm install react react-dom\n\nThen add these lines of code at the top of your main JavaScript file (it might be called index.js or main.js):\n\nindex.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n// Clear the existing HTML content\ndocument.body.innerHTML = '<div id=\"app\"></div>';\n\n// Render your React component instead\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));\nroot.render(<h1>Hello, world</h1>);\n\n\n\nIf the entire content of your page was replaced by a “Hello, world!”, everything worked! Keep reading.\n\nNote\n\nIntegrating a modular JavaScript environment into an existing project for the first time can feel intimidating, but it’s worth it! If you get stuck, try our community resources or the Vite Chat.\n\nStep 2: Render React components anywhere on the page \n\nIn the previous step, you put this code at the top of your main file:\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\n// Clear the existing HTML content\n\ndocument.body.innerHTML = '<div id=\"app\"></div>';\n\n\n\n// Render your React component instead\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));\n\nroot.render(<h1>Hello, world</h1>);\n\nOf course, you don’t actually want to clear the existing HTML content!\n\nDelete this code.\n\nInstead, you probably want to render your React components in specific places in your HTML. Open your HTML page (or the server templates that generate it) and add a unique id attribute to any tag, for example:\n\n<!-- ... somewhere in your html ... -->\n\n<nav id=\"navigation\"></nav>\n\n<!-- ... more html ... -->\n\nThis lets you find that HTML element with document.getElementById and pass it to createRoot so that you can render your own React component inside:\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nfunction NavigationBar() {\n  // TODO: Actually implement a navigation bar\n  return <h1>Hello from React!</h1>;\n}\n\nconst domNode = document.getElementById('navigation');\nconst root = createRoot(domNode);\nroot.render(<NavigationBar />);\n\n\n\nNotice how the original HTML content from index.html is preserved, but your own NavigationBar React component now appears inside the <nav id=\"navigation\"> from your HTML. Read the createRoot usage documentation to learn more about rendering React components inside an existing HTML page.\n\nWhen you adopt React in an existing project, it’s common to start with small interactive components (like buttons), and then gradually keep “moving upwards” until eventually your entire page is built with React. If you ever reach that point, we recommend migrating to a React framework right after to get the most out of React.\n\nUsing React Native in an existing native mobile app \n\nReact Native can also be integrated into existing native apps incrementally. If you have an existing native app for Android (Java or Kotlin) or iOS (Objective-C or Swift), follow this guide to add a React Native screen to it.\n\nPREVIOUS\nStart a New React Project\nNEXT\nEditor Setup"

If this is your first time setting up an editor or you’re looking to tune up your current editor, we have a few recommendations.\n\nYou will learn\nWhat the most popular editors are\nHow to format your code automatically\nYour editor \n\nVS Code is one of the most popular editors in use today. It has a large marketplace of extensions and integrates well with popular services like GitHub. Most of the features listed below can be added to VS Code as extensions as well, making it highly configurable!\n\nOther popular text editors used in the React community include:\n\nWebStorm is an integrated development environment designed specifically for JavaScript.\nSublime Text has support for JSX and TypeScript, syntax highlighting and autocomplete built in.\nVim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as “vi” with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.\nRecommended text editor features \n\nSome editors come with these features built in, but others might require adding an extension. Check to see what support your editor of choice provides to be sure!\n\nLinting \n\nCode linters find problems in your code as you write, helping you fix them early. ESLint is a popular, open source linter for JavaScript.\n\nInstall ESLint with the recommended configuration for React (be sure you have Node installed!)\nIntegrate ESLint in VSCode with the official extension\n\nMake sure that you’ve enabled all the eslint-plugin-react-hooks rules for your project. They are essential and catch the most severe bugs early. The recommended eslint-config-react-app preset already includes them.\n\nFormatting \n\nThe last thing you want to do when sharing your code with another contributor is get into an discussion about tabs vs spaces! Fortunately, Prettier will clean up your code by reformatting it to conform to preset, configurable rules. Run Prettier, and all your tabs will be converted to spaces—and your indentation, quotes, etc will also all be changed to conform to the configuration. In the ideal setup, Prettier will run when you save your file, quickly making these edits for you.\n\nYou can install the Prettier extension in VSCode by following these steps:\n\nLaunch VS Code\nUse Quick Open (press Ctrl/Cmd+P)\nPaste in ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode\nPress Enter\nFormatting on save \n\nIdeally, you should format your code on every save. VS Code has settings for this!\n\nIn VS Code, press CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P.\nType “settings”\nHit Enter\nIn the search bar, type “format on save”\nBe sure the “format on save” option is ticked!\n\nIf your ESLint preset has formatting rules, they may conflict with Prettier. We recommend disabling all formatting rules in your ESLint preset using eslint-config-prettier so that ESLint is only used for catching logical mistakes. If you want to enforce that files are formatted before a pull request is merged, use prettier --check for your continuous integration.\n\nPREVIOUS\nAdd React to an Existing Project\nNEXT\nUsing TypeScript"

The Next.js team has agreed to collaborate with us in researching, developing, integrating, and testing framework-agnostic bleeding-edge React features like React Server Components.\n\nThese features are getting closer to being production-ready every day, and we’ve been in talks with other bundler and framework developers about integrating them. Our hope is that in a year or two, all frameworks listed on this page will have full support for these features. (If you’re a framework author interested in partnering with us to experiment with these features, please let us know!)\n\nNext.js (App Router) \n\nNext.js’s App Router is a redesign of the Next.js APIs aiming to fulfill the React team’s full-stack architecture vision. It lets you fetch data in asynchronous components that run on the server or even during the build.\n\nNext.js is maintained by Vercel. You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports static export which doesn’t require a server.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhich features make up the React team’s full-stack architecture vision? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nInstallation\nNEXT\nAdd React to an Existing Project"

    "html": "QUICK START\nTutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nYou will build a small tic-tac-toe game during this tutorial. This tutorial does not assume any existing React knowledge. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React app, and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of React.\n\nNote\n\nThis tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible. If you prefer learning each concept step by step, start with Describing the UI.\n\nThe tutorial is divided into several sections:\n\nSetup for the tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.\nOverview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.\nCompleting the game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.\nAdding time travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.\nWhat are you building? \n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.\n\nYou can see what it will look like when you’re finished here:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    if (xIsNext) {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    } else {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'O';\n    }\n    onPlay(nextSquares);\n  }\n\n  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);\n  let status;\n  if (winner) {\n    status = 'Winner: ' + winner;\n  } else {\n    status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"status\">{status}</div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />\n        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />\n        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />\n        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />\n        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />\n        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />\n        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Game() {\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n  const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0);\n  const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0;\n  const currentSquares = history[currentMove];\n\n  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n    const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares];\n    setHistory(nextHistory);\n    setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1);\n  }\n\n  function jumpTo(nextMove) {\n    setCurrentMove(nextMove);\n  }\n\n  const moves = history.map((squares, move) => {\n    let description;\n    if (move > 0) {\n      description = 'Go to move #' + move;\n    } else {\n      description = 'Go to game start';\n    }\n    return (\n      <li key={move}>\n        <button onClick={() => jumpTo(move)}>{description}</button>\n      </li>\n    );\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"game\">\n      <div className=\"game-board\">\n        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"game-info\">\n        <ol>{moves}</ol>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction calculateWinner(squares) {\n  const lines = [\n    [0, 1, 2],\n    [3, 4, 5],\n    [6, 7, 8],\n    [0, 3, 6],\n    [1, 4, 7],\n    [2, 5, 8],\n    [0, 4, 8],\n    [2, 4, 6],\n  ];\n  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {\n    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];\n    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {\n      return squares[a];\n    }\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf the code doesn’t make sense to you yet, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.\n\nWe recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game above before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.\n\nOnce you’ve played around with the finished tic-tac-toe game, keep scrolling. You’ll start with a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.\n\nSetup for the tutorial \n\nIn the live code editor below, click Fork in the top-right corner to open the editor in a new tab using the website CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox lets you write code in your browser and preview how your users will see the app you’ve created. The new tab should display an empty square and the starter code for this tutorial.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Square() {\n  return <button className=\"square\">X</button>;\n}\n\n\nNote\n\nYou can also follow this tutorial using your local development environment. To do this, you need to:\n\nInstall Node.js\nIn the CodeSandbox tab you opened earlier, press the top-left corner button to open the menu, and then choose File > Export to ZIP in that menu to download an archive of the files locally\nUnzip the archive, then open a terminal and cd to the directory you unzipped\nInstall the dependencies with npm install\nRun npm start to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser\n\nIf you get stuck, don’t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later.\n\nOverview \n\nNow that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of React!\n\nInspecting the starter code \n\nIn CodeSandbox you’ll see three main sections:\n\nThe Files section with a list of files like App.js, index.js, styles.css and a folder called public\nThe code editor where you’ll see the source code of your selected file\nThe browser section where you’ll see how the code you’ve written will be displayed\n\nThe App.js file should be selected in the Files section. The contents of that file in the code editor should be:\n\nexport default function Square() {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">X</button>;\n\n}\n\nThe browser section should be displaying a square with a X in it like this:\n\nNow let’s have a look at the files in the starter code.\n\nApp.js \n\nThe code in App.js creates a component. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application. Let’s look at the component line by line to see what’s going on:\n\nexport default function Square() {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">X</button>;\n\n}\n\nThe first line defines a function called Square. The export JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file. The default keyword tells other files using your code that it’s the main function in your file.\n\nexport default function Square() {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">X</button>;\n\n}\n\nThe second line returns a button. The return JavaScript keyword means whatever comes after is returned as a value to the caller of the function. <button> is a JSX element. A JSX element is a combination of JavaScript code and HTML tags that describes what you’d like to display. className=\"square\" is a button property or prop that tells CSS how to style the button. X is the text displayed inside of the button and </button> closes the JSX element to indicate that any following content shouldn’t be placed inside the button.\n\nstyles.css \n\nClick on the file labeled styles.css in the Files section of CodeSandbox. This file defines the styles for your React app. The first two CSS selectors (* and body) define the style of large parts of your app while the .square selector defines the style of any component where the className property is set to square. In your code, that would match the button from your Square component in the App.js file.\n\nindex.js \n\nClick on the file labeled index.js in the Files section of CodeSandbox. You won’t be editing this file during the tutorial but it is the bridge between the component you created in the App.js file and the web browser.\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport './styles.css';\n\n\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nLines 1-5 brings all the necessary pieces together:\n\nReact\nReact’s library to talk to web browsers (React DOM)\nthe styles for your components\nthe component you created in App.js.\n\nThe remainder of the file brings all the pieces together and injects the final product into index.html in the public folder.\n\nBuilding the board \n\nLet’s get back to App.js. This is where you’ll spend the rest of the tutorial.\n\nCurrently the board is only a single square, but you need nine! If you just try and copy paste your square to make two squares like this:\n\nexport default function Square() {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">X</button><button className=\"square\">X</button>;\n\n}\n\nYou’ll get this error:\n\nConsole\n/src/App.js: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want a JSX Fragment <>...</>?\n\nReact components need to return a single JSX element and not multiple adjacent JSX elements like two buttons. To fix this you can use Fragments (<> and </>) to wrap multiple adjacent JSX elements like this:\n\nexport default function Square() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <button className=\"square\">X</button>\n\n      <button className=\"square\">X</button>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow you should see:\n\nGreat! Now you just need to copy-paste a few times to add nine squares and…\n\nOh no! The squares are all in a single line, not in a grid like you need for our board. To fix this you’ll need to group your squares into rows with divs and add some CSS classes. While you’re at it, you’ll give each square a number to make sure you know where each square is displayed.\n\nIn the App.js file, update the Square component to look like this:\n\nexport default function Square() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <button className=\"square\">1</button>\n\n        <button className=\"square\">2</button>\n\n        <button className=\"square\">3</button>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <button className=\"square\">4</button>\n\n        <button className=\"square\">5</button>\n\n        <button className=\"square\">6</button>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <button className=\"square\">7</button>\n\n        <button className=\"square\">8</button>\n\n        <button className=\"square\">9</button>\n\n      </div>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe CSS defined in styles.css styles the divs with the className of board-row. Now that you’ve grouped your components into rows with the styled divs you have your tic-tac-toe board:\n\nBut you now have a problem. Your component named Square, really isn’t a square anymore. Let’s fix that by changing the name to Board:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\nAt this point your code should look something like this:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Board() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <button className=\"square\">1</button>\n        <button className=\"square\">2</button>\n        <button className=\"square\">3</button>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <button className=\"square\">4</button>\n        <button className=\"square\">5</button>\n        <button className=\"square\">6</button>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <button className=\"square\">7</button>\n        <button className=\"square\">8</button>\n        <button className=\"square\">9</button>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nPsssst… That’s a lot to type! It’s okay to copy and paste code from this page. However, if you’re up for a little challenge, we recommend only copying code that you’ve manually typed at least once yourself.\n\nPassing data through props \n\nNext, you’ll want to change the value of a square from empty to “X” when the user clicks on the square. With how you’ve built the board so far you would need to copy-paste the code that updates the square nine times (once for each square you have)! Instead of copy-pasting, React’s component architecture allows you to create a reusable component to avoid messy, duplicated code.\n\nFirst, you are going to copy the line defining your first square (<button className=\"square\">1</button>) from your Board component into a new Square component:\n\nfunction Square() {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">1</button>;\n\n}\n\n\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThen you’ll update the Board component to render that Square component using JSX syntax:\n\n// ...\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n      </div>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNote how unlike the browser divs, your own components Board and Square must start with a capital letter.\n\nLet’s take a look:\n\nOh no! You lost the numbered squares you had before. Now each square says “1”. To fix this, you will use props to pass the value each square should have from the parent component (Board) to its child (Square).\n\nUpdate the Square component to read the value prop that you’ll pass from the Board:\n\nfunction Square({ value }) {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">1</button>;\n\n}\n\nfunction Square({ value }) indicates the Square component can be passed a prop called value.\n\nNow you want to display that value instead of 1 inside every square. Try doing it like this:\n\nfunction Square({ value }) {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">value</button>;\n\n}\n\nOops, this is not what you wanted:\n\nYou wanted to render the JavaScript variable called value from your component, not the word “value”. To “escape into JavaScript” from JSX, you need curly braces. Add curly braces around value in JSX like so:\n\nfunction Square({ value }) {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>;\n\n}\n\nFor now, you should see an empty board:\n\nThis is because the Board component hasn’t passed the value prop to each Square component it renders yet. To fix it you’ll add the value prop to each Square component rendered by the Board component:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value=\"1\" />\n\n        <Square value=\"2\" />\n\n        <Square value=\"3\" />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value=\"4\" />\n\n        <Square value=\"5\" />\n\n        <Square value=\"6\" />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value=\"7\" />\n\n        <Square value=\"8\" />\n\n        <Square value=\"9\" />\n\n      </div>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow you should see a grid of numbers again:\n\nYour updated code should look like this:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nfunction Square({ value }) {\n  return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>;\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value=\"1\" />\n        <Square value=\"2\" />\n        <Square value=\"3\" />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value=\"4\" />\n        <Square value=\"5\" />\n        <Square value=\"6\" />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value=\"7\" />\n        <Square value=\"8\" />\n        <Square value=\"9\" />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nMaking an interactive component \n\nLet’s fill the Square component with an X when you click it. Declare a function called handleClick inside of the Square. Then, add onClick to the props of the button JSX element returned from the Square:\n\nfunction Square({ value }) {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    console.log('clicked!');\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <button\n\n      className=\"square\"\n\n      onClick={handleClick}\n\n    >\n\n      {value}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf you click on a square now, you should see a log saying \"clicked!\" in the Console tab at the bottom of the Browser section in CodeSandbox. Clicking the square more than once will log \"clicked!\" again. Repeated console logs with the same message will not create more lines in the console. Instead, you will see an incrementing counter next to your first \"clicked!\" log.\n\nNote\n\nIf you are following this tutorial using your local development environment, you need to open your browser’s Console. For example, if you use the Chrome browser, you can view the Console with the keyboard shortcut Shift + Ctrl + J (on Windows/Linux) or Option + ⌘ + J (on macOS).\n\nAs a next step, you want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked, and fill it with an “X” mark. To “remember” things, components use state.\n\nReact provides a special function called useState that you can call from your component to let it “remember” things. Let’s store the current value of the Square in state, and change it when the Square is clicked.\n\nImport useState at the top of the file. Remove the value prop from the Square component. Instead, add a new line at the start of the Square that calls useState. Have it return a state variable called value:\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Square() {\n\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    //...\n\nvalue stores the value and setValue is a function that can be used to change the value. The null passed to useState is used as the initial value for this state variable, so value here starts off equal to null.\n\nSince the Square component no longer accepts props anymore, you’ll remove the value prop from all nine of the Square components created by the Board component:\n\n// ...\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n        <Square />\n\n      </div>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow you’ll change Square to display an “X” when clicked. Replace the console.log(\"clicked!\"); event handler with setValue('X');. Now your Square component looks like this:\n\nfunction Square() {\n\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setValue('X');\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <button\n\n      className=\"square\"\n\n      onClick={handleClick}\n\n    >\n\n      {value}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBy calling this set function from an onClick handler, you’re telling React to re-render that Square whenever its <button> is clicked. After the update, the Square’s value will be 'X', so you’ll see the “X” on the game board. Click on any Square, and “X” should show up:\n\nEach Square has its own state: the value stored in each Square is completely independent of the others. When you call a set function in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside too.\n\nAfter you’ve made the above changes, your code will look like this:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setValue('X');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      className=\"square\"\n      onClick={handleClick}\n    >\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square />\n        <Square />\n        <Square />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square />\n        <Square />\n        <Square />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square />\n        <Square />\n        <Square />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nReact Developer Tools \n\nReact DevTools let you check the props and the state of your React components. You can find the React DevTools tab at the bottom of the browser section in CodeSandbox:\n\nTo inspect a particular component on the screen, use the button in the top left corner of React DevTools:\n\nNote\n\nFor local development, React DevTools is available as a Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browser extension. Install it, and the Components tab will appear in your browser Developer Tools for sites using React.\n\nCompleting the game \n\nBy this point, you have all the basic building blocks for your tic-tac-toe game. To have a complete game, you now need to alternate placing “X”s and “O”s on the board, and you need a way to determine a winner.\n\nLifting state up \n\nCurrently, each Square component maintains a part of the game’s state. To check for a winner in a tic-tac-toe game, the Board would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9 Square components.\n\nHow would you approach that? At first, you might guess that the Board needs to “ask” each Square for that Square’s state. Although this approach is technically possible in React, we discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to bugs, and hard to refactor. Instead, the best approach is to store the game’s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square. The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each Square.\n\nTo collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.\n\nLifting state into a parent component is common when React components are refactored.\n\nLet’s take this opportunity to try it out. Edit the Board component so that it declares a state variable named squares that defaults to an array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares:\n\n// ...\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n  return (\n\n    // ...\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nArray(9).fill(null) creates an array with nine elements and sets each of them to null. The useState() call around it declares a squares state variable that’s initially set to that array. Each entry in the array corresponds to the value of a square. When you fill the board in later, the squares array will look like this:\n\n['O', null, 'X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', null, null]\n\nNow your Board component needs to pass the value prop down to each Square that it renders:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[0]} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[1]} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[2]} />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[3]} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[4]} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[5]} />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[6]} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[7]} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[8]} />\n\n      </div>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNext, you’ll edit the Square component to receive the value prop from the Board component. This will require removing the Square component’s own stateful tracking of value and the button’s onClick prop:\n\nfunction Square({value}) {\n\n  return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>;\n\n}\n\nAt this point you should see an empty tic-tac-toe board:\n\nAnd your code should look like this:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({ value }) {\n  return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>;\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[0]} />\n        <Square value={squares[1]} />\n        <Square value={squares[2]} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[3]} />\n        <Square value={squares[4]} />\n        <Square value={squares[5]} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[6]} />\n        <Square value={squares[7]} />\n        <Square value={squares[8]} />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nEach Square will now receive a value prop that will either be 'X', 'O', or null for empty squares.\n\nNext, you need to change what happens when a Square is clicked. The Board component now maintains which squares are filled. You’ll need to create a way for the Square to update the Board’s state. Since state is private to a component that defines it, you cannot update the Board’s state directly from Square.\n\nInstead, you’ll pass down a function from the Board component to the Square component, and you’ll have Square call that function when a square is clicked. You’ll start with the function that the Square component will call when it is clicked. You’ll call that function onSquareClick:\n\nfunction Square({ value }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n\n      {value}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNext, you’ll add the onSquareClick function to the Square component’s props:\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n\n      {value}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow you’ll connect the onSquareClick prop to a function in the Board component that you’ll name handleClick. To connect onSquareClick to handleClick you’ll pass a function to the onSquareClick prop of the first Square component:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={handleClick} />\n\n        //...\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nLastly, you will define the handleClick function inside the Board component to update the squares array holding your board’s state:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n\n    nextSquares[0] = \"X\";\n\n    setSquares(nextSquares);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    // ...\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nThe handleClick function creates a copy of the squares array (nextSquares) with the JavaScript slice() Array method. Then, handleClick updates the nextSquares array to add X to the first ([0] index) square.\n\nCalling the setSquares function lets React know the state of the component has changed. This will trigger a re-render of the components that use the squares state (Board) as well as its child components (the Square components that make up the board).\n\nNote\n\nJavaScript supports closures which means an inner function (e.g. handleClick) has access to variables and functions defined in a outer function (e.g. Board). The handleClick function can read the squares state and call the setSquares method because they are both defined inside of the Board function.\n\nNow you can add X’s to the board…  but only to the upper left square. Your handleClick function is hardcoded to update the index for the upper left square (0). Let’s update handleClick to be able to update any square. Add an argument i to the handleClick function that takes the index of the square to update:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n\n\n  function handleClick(i) {\n\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n\n    nextSquares[i] = \"X\";\n\n    setSquares(nextSquares);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    // ...\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nNext, you will need to pass that i to handleClick. You could try to set the onSquareClick prop of square to be handleClick(0) directly in the JSX like this, but it won’t work:\n\n<Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={handleClick(0)} />\n\nHere is why this doesn’t work. The handleClick(0) call will be a part of rendering the board component. Because handleClick(0) alters the state of the board component by calling setSquares, your entire board component will be re-rendered again. But this runs handleClick(0) again, leading to an infinite loop:\n\nConsole\nToo many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.\n\nWhy didn’t this problem happen earlier?\n\nWhen you were passing onSquareClick={handleClick}, you were passing the handleClick function down as a prop. You were not calling it! But now you are calling that function right away—notice the parentheses in handleClick(0)—and that’s why it runs too early. You don’t want to call handleClick until the user clicks!\n\nYou could fix this by creating a function like handleFirstSquareClick that calls handleClick(0), a function like handleSecondSquareClick that calls handleClick(1), and so on. You would pass (rather than call) these functions down as props like onSquareClick={handleFirstSquareClick}. This would solve the infinite loop.\n\nHowever, defining nine different functions and giving each of them a name is too verbose. Instead, let’s do this:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />\n\n        // ...\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNotice the new () => syntax. Here, () => handleClick(0) is an arrow function, which is a shorter way to define functions. When the square is clicked, the code after the => “arrow” will run, calling handleClick(0).\n\nNow you need to update the other eight squares to call handleClick from the arrow functions you pass. Make sure that the argument for each call of the handleClick corresponds to the index of the correct square:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />\n\n        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />\n\n      </div>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n};\n\nNow you can again add X’s to any square on the board by clicking on them:\n\nBut this time all the state management is handled by the Board component!\n\nThis is what your code should look like:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    setSquares(nextSquares);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />\n        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />\n        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />\n        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />\n        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />\n        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />\n        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNow that your state handling is in the Board component, the parent Board component passes props to the child Square components so that they can be displayed correctly. When clicking on a Square, the child Square component now asks the parent Board component to update the state of the board. When the Board’s state changes, both the Board component and every child Square re-renders automatically. Keeping the state of all squares in the Board component will allow it to determine the winner in the future.\n\nLet’s recap what happens when a user clicks the top left square on your board to add an X to it:\n\nClicking on the upper left square runs the function that the button received as its onClick prop from the Square. The Square component received that function as its onSquareClick prop from the Board. The Board component defined that function directly in the JSX. It calls handleClick with an argument of 0.\nhandleClick uses the argument (0) to update the first element of the squares array from null to X.\nThe squares state of the Board component was updated, so the Board and all of its children re-render. This causes the value prop of the Square component with index 0 to change from null to X.\n\nIn the end the user sees that the upper left square has changed from empty to having a X after clicking it.\n\nNote\n\nThe DOM <button> element’s onClick attribute has a special meaning to React because it is a built-in component. For custom components like Square, the naming is up to you. You could give any name to the Square’s onSquareClick prop or Board’s handleClick function, and the code would work the same. In React, it’s conventional to use onSomething names for props which represent events and handleSomething for the function definitions which handle those events.\n\nWhy immutability is important \n\nNote how in handleClick, you call .slice() to create a copy of the squares array instead of modifying the existing array. To explain why, we need to discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.\n\nThere are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the squares array:\n\nconst squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\n\nsquares[0] = 'X';\n\n// Now `squares` is [\"X\", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\n\nAnd here is what it would look like if you changed data without mutating the squares array:\n\nconst squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\n\nconst nextSquares = ['X', null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];\n\n// Now `squares` is unchanged, but `nextSquares` first element is 'X' rather than `null`\n\nThe result is the same but by not mutating (changing the underlying data) directly, you gain several benefits.\n\nImmutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, you will implement a “time travel” feature that lets you review the game’s history and “jump back” to past moves. This functionality isn’t specific to games—an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.\n\nThere is also another benefit of immutability. By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of a parent component changes. This includes even the child components that weren’t affected by the change. Although re-rendering is not by itself noticeable to the user (you shouldn’t actively try to avoid it!), you might want to skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn’t affected by it for performance reasons. Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not. You can learn more about how React chooses when to re-render a component in the memo API reference.\n\nTaking turns \n\nIt’s now time to fix a major defect in this tic-tac-toe game: the “O”s cannot be marked on the board.\n\nYou’ll set the first move to be “X” by default. Let’s keep track of this by adding another piece of state to the Board component:\n\nfunction Board() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nEach time a player moves, xIsNext (a boolean) will be flipped to determine which player goes next and the game’s state will be saved. You’ll update the Board’s handleClick function to flip the value of xIsNext:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n\n\n  function handleClick(i) {\n\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n\n    if (xIsNext) {\n\n      nextSquares[i] = \"X\";\n\n    } else {\n\n      nextSquares[i] = \"O\";\n\n    }\n\n    setSquares(nextSquares);\n\n    setXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    //...\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow, as you click on different squares, they will alternate between X and O, as they should!\n\nBut wait, there’s a problem. Try clicking on the same square multiple times:\n\nThe X is overwritten by an O! While this would add a very interesting twist to the game, we’re going to stick to the original rules for now.\n\nWhen you mark a square with a X or an O you aren’t first checking to see if the square already has a X or O value. You can fix this by returning early. You’ll check to see if the square already has a X or an O. If the square is already filled, you will return in the handleClick function early—before it tries to update the board state.\n\nfunction handleClick(i) {\n\n  if (squares[i]) {\n\n    return;\n\n  }\n\n  const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\nNow you can only add X’s or O’s to empty squares! Here is what your code should look like at this point:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({value, onSquareClick}) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    if (squares[i]) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    if (xIsNext) {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    } else {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'O';\n    }\n    setSquares(nextSquares);\n    setXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />\n        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />\n        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />\n        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />\n        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />\n        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />\n        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDeclaring a winner \n\nNow that the players can take turns, you’ll want to show when the game is won and there are no more turns to make. To do this you’ll add a helper function called calculateWinner that takes an array of 9 squares, checks for a winner and returns 'X', 'O', or null as appropriate. Don’t worry too much about the calculateWinner function; it’s not specific to React:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction calculateWinner(squares) {\n\n  const lines = [\n\n    [0, 1, 2],\n\n    [3, 4, 5],\n\n    [6, 7, 8],\n\n    [0, 3, 6],\n\n    [1, 4, 7],\n\n    [2, 5, 8],\n\n    [0, 4, 8],\n\n    [2, 4, 6]\n\n  ];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {\n\n    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];\n\n    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {\n\n      return squares[a];\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return null;\n\n}\nNote\n\nIt does not matter whether you define calculateWinner before or after the Board. Let’s put it at the end so that you don’t have to scroll past it every time you edit your components.\n\nYou will call calculateWinner(squares) in the Board component’s handleClick function to check if a player has won. You can perform this check at the same time you check if a user has clicked a square that already has a X or and O. We’d like to return early in both cases:\n\nfunction handleClick(i) {\n\n  if (squares[i] || calculateWinner(squares)) {\n\n    return;\n\n  }\n\n  const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\nTo let the players know when the game is over, you can display text such as “Winner: X” or “Winner: O”. To do that you’ll add a status section to the Board component. The status will display the winner if the game is over and if the game is ongoing you’ll display which player’s turn is next:\n\nexport default function Board() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);\n\n  let status;\n\n  if (winner) {\n\n    status = \"Winner: \" + winner;\n\n  } else {\n\n    status = \"Next player: \" + (xIsNext ? \"X\" : \"O\");\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <div className=\"status\">{status}</div>\n\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n\n        // ...\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nCongratulations! You now have a working tic-tac-toe game. And you’ve just learned the basics of React too. So you are the real winner here. Here is what the code should look like:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({value, onSquareClick}) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Board() {\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));\n\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    if (xIsNext) {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    } else {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'O';\n    }\n    setSquares(nextSquares);\n    setXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n  }\n\n  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);\n  let status;\n  if (winner) {\n    status = 'Winner: ' + winner;\n  } else {\n    status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"status\">{status}</div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />\n        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />\n        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />\n        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />\n        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />\n        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />\n        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction calculateWinner(squares) {\n  const lines = [\n    [0, 1, 2],\n    [3, 4, 5],\n    [6, 7, 8],\n    [0, 3, 6],\n    [1, 4, 7],\n    [2, 5, 8],\n    [0, 4, 8],\n    [2, 4, 6],\n  ];\n  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {\n    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];\n    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {\n      return squares[a];\n    }\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nAdding time travel \n\nAs a final exercise, let’s make it possible to “go back in time” to the previous moves in the game.\n\nStoring a history of moves \n\nIf you mutated the squares array, implementing time travel would be very difficult.\n\nHowever, you used slice() to create a new copy of the squares array after every move, and treated it as immutable. This will allow you to store every past version of the squares array, and navigate between the turns that have already happened.\n\nYou’ll store the past squares arrays in another array called history, which you’ll store as a new state variable. The history array represents all board states, from the first to the last move, and has a shape like this:\n\n[\n\n  // Before first move\n\n  [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],\n\n  // After first move\n\n  [null, null, null, null, 'X', null, null, null, null],\n\n  // After second move\n\n  [null, null, null, null, 'X', null, null, null, 'O'],\n\n  // ...\n\n]\nLifting state up, again \n\nYou will now write a new top-level component called Game to display a list of past moves. That’s where you will place the history state that contains the entire game history.\n\nPlacing the history state into the Game component will let you remove the squares state from its child Board component. Just like you “lifted state up” from the Square component into the Board component, you will now lift it up from the Board into the top-level Game component. This gives the Game component full control over the Board’s data and lets it instruct the Board to render previous turns from the history.\n\nFirst, add a Game component with export default. Have it render the Board component and some markup:\n\nfunction Board() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"game\">\n\n      <div className=\"game-board\">\n\n        <Board />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"game-info\">\n\n        <ol>{/*TODO*/}</ol>\n\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNote that you are removing the export default keywords before the function Board() { declaration and adding them before the function Game() { declaration. This tells your index.js file to use the Game component as the top-level component instead of your Board component. The additional divs returned by the Game component are making room for the game information you’ll add to the board later.\n\nAdd some state to the Game component to track which player is next and the history of moves:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice how [Array(9).fill(null)] is an array with a single item, which itself is an array of 9 nulls.\n\nTo render the squares for the current move, you’ll want to read the last squares array from the history. You don’t need useState for this—you already have enough information to calculate it during rendering:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n\n  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];\n\n  // ...\n\nNext, create a handlePlay function inside the Game component that will be called by the Board component to update the game. Pass xIsNext, currentSquares and handlePlay as props to the Board component:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n\n  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];\n\n\n\n  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n\n    // TODO\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"game\">\n\n      <div className=\"game-board\">\n\n        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />\n\n        //...\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nLet’s make the Board component fully controlled by the props it receives. Change the Board component to take three props: xIsNext, squares, and a new onPlay function that Board can call with the updated squares array when a player makes a move. Next, remove the first two lines of the Board function that call useState:\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\n\n  function handleClick(i) {\n\n    //...\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow replace the setSquares and setXIsNext calls in handleClick in the Board component with a single call to your new onPlay function so the Game component can update the Board when the user clicks a square:\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\n\n  function handleClick(i) {\n\n    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\n\n      return;\n\n    }\n\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n\n    if (xIsNext) {\n\n      nextSquares[i] = \"X\";\n\n    } else {\n\n      nextSquares[i] = \"O\";\n\n    }\n\n    onPlay(nextSquares);\n\n  }\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\nThe Board component is fully controlled by the props passed to it by the Game component. You need to implement the handlePlay function in the Game component to get the game working again.\n\nWhat should handlePlay do when called? Remember that Board used to call setSquares with an updated array; now it passes the updated squares array to onPlay.\n\nThe handlePlay function needs to update Game’s state to trigger a re-render, but you don’t have a setSquares function that you can call any more—you’re now using the history state variable to store this information. You’ll want to update history by appending the updated squares array as a new history entry. You also want to toggle xIsNext, just as Board used to do:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  //...\n\n  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n\n    setHistory([...history, nextSquares]);\n\n    setXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n\n  }\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\nHere, [...history, nextSquares] creates a new array that contains all the items in history, followed by nextSquares. (You can read the ...history spread syntax as “enumerate all the items in history”.)\n\nFor example, if history is [[null,null,null], [\"X\",null,null]] and nextSquares is [\"X\",null,\"O\"], then the new [...history, nextSquares] array will be [[null,null,null], [\"X\",null,null], [\"X\",null,\"O\"]].\n\nAt this point, you’ve moved the state to live in the Game component, and the UI should be fully working, just as it was before the refactor. Here is what the code should look like at this point:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    if (xIsNext) {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    } else {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'O';\n    }\n    onPlay(nextSquares);\n  }\n\n  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);\n  let status;\n  if (winner) {\n    status = 'Winner: ' + winner;\n  } else {\n    status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"status\">{status}</div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />\n        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />\n        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />\n        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />\n        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"board-row\">\n        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />\n        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />\n        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Game() {\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];\n\n  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n    setHistory([...history, nextSquares]);\n    setXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"game\">\n      <div className=\"game-board\">\n        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"game-info\">\n        <ol>{/*TODO*/}</ol>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction calculateWinner(squares) {\n  const lines = [\n    [0, 1, 2],\n    [3, 4, 5],\n    [6, 7, 8],\n    [0, 3, 6],\n    [1, 4, 7],\n    [2, 5, 8],\n    [0, 4, 8],\n    [2, 4, 6],\n  ];\n  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {\n    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];\n    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {\n      return squares[a];\n    }\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nShowing the past moves \n\nSince you are recording the tic-tac-toe game’s history, you can now display a list of past moves to the player.\n\nReact elements like <button> are regular JavaScript objects; you can pass them around in your application. To render multiple items in React, you can use an array of React elements.\n\nYou already have an array of history moves in state, so now you need to transform it to an array of React elements. In JavaScript, to transform one array into another, you can use the array map method:\n\n[1, 2, 3].map((x) => x * 2) // [2, 4, 6]\n\nYou’ll use map to transform your history of moves into React elements representing buttons on the screen, and display a list of buttons to “jump” to past moves. Let’s map over the history in the Game component:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n\n  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];\n\n\n\n  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n\n    setHistory([...history, nextSquares]);\n\n    setXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function jumpTo(nextMove) {\n\n    // TODO\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  const moves = history.map((squares, move) => {\n\n    let description;\n\n    if (move > 0) {\n\n      description = 'Go to move #' + move;\n\n    } else {\n\n      description = 'Go to game start';\n\n    }\n\n    return (\n\n      <li>\n\n        <button onClick={() => jumpTo(move)}>{description}</button>\n\n      </li>\n\n    );\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"game\">\n\n      <div className=\"game-board\">\n\n        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />\n\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"game-info\">\n\n        <ol>{moves}</ol>\n\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou can see what your code should look like below. Note that you should see an error in the developer tools console that says:\n\nConsole\nWarning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique “key” prop. Check the render method of `Game`.\n\nYou’ll fix this error in the next section.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    if (xIsNext) {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    } else {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'O';\n    }\n    onPlay(nextSquares);\n  }\n\n  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);\n  let status;\n  if (winner) {\n    status = 'Winner: ' + winner;\n  } else {\n    status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsNext ?

(In most cases, you’d need the actual array elements, but to render a list of moves you will only need indexes.)\n\nFor each move in the tic-tac-toe game’s history, you create a list item <li> which contains a button <button>. The button has an onClick handler which calls a function called jumpTo (that you haven’t implemented yet).\n\nFor now, you should see a list of the moves that occurred in the game and an error in the developer tools console. Let’s discuss what the “key” error means.\n\nPicking a key \n\nWhen you render a list, React stores some information about each rendered list item. When you update a list, React needs to determine what has changed. You could have added, removed, re-arranged, or updated the list’s items.\n\nImagine transitioning from\n\n<li>Alexa: 7 tasks left</li>\n\n<li>Ben: 5 tasks left</li>\n\nto\n\n<li>Ben: 9 tasks left</li>\n\n<li>Claudia: 8 tasks left</li>\n\n<li>Alexa: 5 tasks left</li>\n\nIn addition to the updated counts, a human reading this would probably say that you swapped Alexa and Ben’s ordering and inserted Claudia between Alexa and Ben. However, React is a computer program and does not know what you intended, so you need to specify a key property for each list item to differentiate each list item from its siblings. If your data was from a database, Alexa, Ben, and Claudia’s database IDs could be used as keys.\n\n<li key={user.id}>\n\n  {user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left\n\n</li>\n\nWhen a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item’s key and searches the previous list’s items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn’t exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved.\n\nKeys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state.\n\nkey is a special and reserved property in React. When an element is created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though key may look like it is passed as props, React automatically uses key to decide which components to update. There’s no way for a component to ask what key its parent specified.\n\nIt’s strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists. If you don’t have an appropriate key, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do.\n\nIf no key is specified, React will report an error and use the array index as a key by default. Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to re-order a list’s items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly passing key={i} silences the error but has the same problems as array indices and is not recommended in most cases.\n\nKeys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings.\n\nImplementing time travel \n\nIn the tic-tac-toe game’s history, each past move has a unique ID associated with it: it’s the sequential number of the move. Moves will never be re-ordered, deleted, or inserted in the middle, so it’s safe to use the move index as a key.\n\nIn the Game function, you can add the key as <li key={move}>, and if you reload the rendered game, React’s “key” error should disappear:\n\nconst moves = history.map((squares, move) => {\n\n  //...\n\n  return (\n\n    <li key={move}>\n\n      <button onClick={() => jumpTo(move)}>{description}</button>\n\n    </li>\n\n  );\n\n});\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    if (xIsNext) {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    } else {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'O';\n    }\n    onPlay(nextSquares);\n  }\n\n  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);\n  let status;\n  if (winner) {\n    status = 'Winner: ' + winner;\n  } else {\n    status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsNext ?

To do this, define a new state variable called currentMove, defaulting to 0:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n\n  const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0);\n\n  const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\nNext, update the jumpTo function inside Game to update that currentMove. You’ll also set xIsNext to true if the number that you’re changing currentMove to is even.\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  function jumpTo(nextMove) {\n\n    setCurrentMove(nextMove);\n\n    setXIsNext(nextMove % 2 === 0);\n\n  }\n\n  //...\n\n}\n\nYou will now make two changes to the Game’s handlePlay function which is called when you click on a square.\n\nIf you “go back in time” and then make a new move from that point, you only want to keep the history up to that point. Instead of adding nextSquares after all items (... spread syntax) in history, you’ll add it after all items in history.slice(0, currentMove + 1) so that you’re only keeping that portion of the old history.\nEach time a move is made, you need to update currentMove to point to the latest history entry.\nfunction handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n\n  const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares];\n\n  setHistory(nextHistory);\n\n  setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1);\n\n  setXIsNext(!xIsNext);\n\n}\n\nFinally, you will modify the Game component to render the currently selected move, instead of always rendering the final move:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);\n\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n\n  const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0);\n\n  const currentSquares = history[currentMove];\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf you click on any step in the game’s history, the tic-tac-toe board should immediately update to show what the board looked like after that step occurred.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Square({value, onSquareClick}) {\n  return (\n    <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}>\n      {value}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {\n  function handleClick(i) {\n    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {\n      return;\n    }\n    const nextSquares = squares.slice();\n    if (xIsNext) {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'X';\n    } else {\n      nextSquares[i] = 'O';\n    }\n    onPlay(nextSquares);\n  }\n\n  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);\n  let status;\n  if (winner) {\n    status = 'Winner: ' + winner;\n  } else {\n    status = 'Next player: ' + (xIsNext ?

In other words, if you know the value of currentMove, then you can always figure out what xIsNext should be.\n\nThere’s no reason for you to store both of these in state. In fact, always try to avoid redundant state. Simplifying what you store in state reduces bugs and makes your code easier to understand. Change Game so that it doesn’t store xIsNext as a separate state variable and instead figures it out based on the currentMove:\n\nexport default function Game() {\n\n  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);\n\n  const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0);\n\n  const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0;\n\n  const currentSquares = history[currentMove];\n\n\n\n  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {\n\n    const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares];\n\n    setHistory(nextHistory);\n\n    setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function jumpTo(nextMove) {\n\n    setCurrentMove(nextMove);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou no longer need the xIsNext state declaration or the calls to setXIsNext. Now, there’s no chance for xIsNext to get out of sync with currentMove, even if you make a mistake while coding the components.\n\nWrapping up \n\nCongratulations!

    "html": "QUICK START\nThinking in React\n\nReact can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called components. Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React.\n\nStart with the mockup \n\nImagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer.\n\nThe JSON API returns some data that looks like this:\n\n[\n\n  { category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Apple\" },\n\n  { category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Dragonfruit\" },\n\n  { category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$2\", stocked: false, name: \"Passionfruit\" },\n\n  { category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$2\", stocked: true, name: \"Spinach\" },\n\n  { category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$4\", stocked: false, name: \"Pumpkin\" },\n\n  { category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Peas\" }\n\n]\n\nThe mockup looks like this:\n\nTo implement a UI in React, you will usually follow the same five steps.\n\nStep 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy \n\nStart by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them. If you work with a designer, they may have already named these components in their design tool. Ask them!\n\nDepending on your background, you can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways:\n\nProgramming—use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.\nCSS—consider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.)\nDesign—consider how you would organize the design’s layers.\n\nIf your JSON is well-structured, you’ll often find that it naturally maps to the component structure of your UI. That’s because UI and data models often have the same information architecture—that is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.\n\nThere are five components on this screen:\n\nFilterableProductTable (grey) contains the entire app.\nSearchBar (blue) receives the user input.\nProductTable (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input.\nProductCategoryRow (green) displays a heading for each category.\nProductRow (yellow) displays a row for each product.\n\nIf you look at ProductTable (lavender), you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and you could go either way. For this example, it is a part of ProductTable because it appears inside the ProductTable’s list. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if you add sorting), you can move it into its own ProductTableHeader component.\n\nNow that you’ve identified the components in the mockup, arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy:\n\nFilterableProductTable\nSearchBar\nProductTable\nProductCategoryRow\nProductRow\nStep 2: Build a static version in React \n\nNow that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity… yet! It’s often easier to build the static version first and add interactivity later. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.\n\nTo build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. Props are a way of passing data from parent to child. (If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.)\n\nYou can either build “top down” by starting with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (like FilterableProductTable) or “bottom up” by working from components lower down (like ProductRow). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction ProductCategoryRow({ category }) {\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <th colSpan=\"2\">\n        {category}\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductRow({ product }) {\n  const name = product.stocked ? product.name :\n    <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>\n      {product.name}\n    </span>;\n\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <td>{name}</td>\n      <td>{product.price}</td>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductTable({ products }) {\n  const rows = [];\n  let lastCategory = null;\n\n  products.forEach((product) => {\n    if (product.category !== lastCategory) {\n      rows.push(\n        <ProductCategoryRow\n          category={product.category}\n          key={product.category} />\n      );\n    }\n    rows.push(\n      <ProductRow\n        product={product}\n        key={product.name} />\n    );\n    lastCategory = product.category;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Price</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>{rows}</tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction SearchBar() {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search...\" />\n      <label>\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n        {' '}\n        Only show products in stock\n      </label>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SearchBar />\n      <ProductTable products={products} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst PRODUCTS = [\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Apple\"},\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Dragonfruit\"},\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$2\", stocked: false, name: \"Passionfruit\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$2\", stocked: true, name: \"Spinach\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$4\", stocked: false, name: \"Pumpkin\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Peas\"}\n];\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\n(If this code looks intimidating, go through the Quick Start first!)\n\nAfter building your components, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. Because this is a static app, the components will only return JSX. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. This is called one-way data flow because the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree.\n\nPitfall\n\nAt this point, you should not be using any state values. That’s for the next step!\n\nStep 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state \n\nTo make the UI interactive, you need to let users change your underlying data model. You will use state for this.\n\nThink of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember. The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. For example, if you’re building a shopping list, you can store the items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number of items in the list, don’t store the number of items as another state value—instead, read the length of your array.\n\nNow think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:\n\nThe original list of products\nThe search text the user has entered\nThe value of the checkbox\nThe filtered list of products\n\nWhich of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:\n\nDoes it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.\nIs it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.\nCan you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!\n\nWhat’s left is probably state.\n\nLet’s go through them one by one again:\n\nThe original list of products is passed in as props, so it’s not state.\nThe search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything.\nThe value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything.\nThe filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.\n\nThis means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done!\n\nDEEP DIVE\nProps vs State \nShow Details\nStep 4: Identify where your state should live \n\nAfter identifying your app’s minimal state data, you need to identify which component is responsible for changing this state, or owns the state. Remember: React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This can be challenging if you’re new to this concept, but you can figure it out by following these steps!\n\nFor each piece of state in your application:\n\nIdentify every component that renders something based on that state.\nFind their closest common parent component—a component above them all in the hierarchy.\nDecide where the state should live:\nOften, you can put the state directly into their common parent.\nYou can also put the state into some component above their common parent.\nIf you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.\n\nIn the previous step, you found two pieces of state in this application: the search input text, and the value of the checkbox. In this example, they always appear together, so it makes sense to put them into the same place.\n\nNow let’s run through our strategy for them:\n\nIdentify components that use state:\nProductTable needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).\nSearchBar needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).\nFind their common parent: The first parent component both components share is FilterableProductTable.\nDecide where the state lives: We’ll keep the filter text and checked state values in FilterableProductTable.\n\nSo the state values will live in FilterableProductTable.\n\nAdd state to the component with the useState() Hook. Hooks are special functions that let you “hook into” React. Add two state variables at the top of FilterableProductTable and specify their initial state:\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');\n\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\nThen, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as props:\n\n<div>\n\n  <SearchBar \n\n    filterText={filterText} \n\n    inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n\n  <ProductTable \n\n    products={products}\n\n    filterText={filterText}\n\n    inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n\n</div>\n\nYou can start seeing how your application will behave. Edit the filterText initial value from useState('') to useState('fruit') in the sandbox code below. You’ll see both the search input text and the table update:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SearchBar \n        filterText={filterText} \n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n      <ProductTable \n        products={products}\n        filterText={filterText}\n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductCategoryRow({ category }) {\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <th colSpan=\"2\">\n        {category}\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductRow({ product }) {\n  const name = product.stocked ? product.name :\n    <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>\n      {product.name}\n    </span>;\n\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <td>{name}</td>\n      <td>{product.price}</td>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductTable({ products, filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n  const rows = [];\n  let lastCategory = null;\n\n  products.forEach((product) => {\n    if (\n      product.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(\n        filterText.toLowerCase()\n      ) === -1\n    ) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (inStockOnly && !product.stocked) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (product.category !== lastCategory) {\n      rows.push(\n        <ProductCategoryRow\n          category={product.category}\n          key={product.category} />\n      );\n    }\n    rows.push(\n      <ProductRow\n        product={product}\n        key={product.name} />\n    );\n    lastCategory = product.category;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Price</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>{rows}</tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction SearchBar({ filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input \n        type=\"text\" \n        value={filterText} \n        placeholder=\"Search...\"/>\n      <label>\n        <input \n          type=\"checkbox\" \n          checked={inStockOnly} />\n        {' '}\n        Only show products in stock\n      </label>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nconst PRODUCTS = [\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Apple\"},\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Dragonfruit\"},\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$2\", stocked: false, name: \"Passionfruit\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$2\", stocked: true, name: \"Spinach\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$4\", stocked: false, name: \"Pumpkin\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Peas\"}\n];\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that editing the form doesn’t work yet. There is a console error in the sandbox above explaining why:\n\nConsole\nYou provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field.\n\nIn the sandbox above, ProductTable and SearchBar read the filterText and inStockOnly props to render the table, the input, and the checkbox. For example, here is how SearchBar populates the input value:\n\nfunction SearchBar({ filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <input \n\n        type=\"text\" \n\n        value={filterText} \n\n        placeholder=\"Search...\"/>\n\nHowever, you haven’t added any code to respond to the user actions like typing yet. This will be your final step.\n\nStep 5: Add inverse data flow \n\nCurrently your app renders correctly with props and state flowing down the hierarchy. But to change the state according to user input, you will need to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.\n\nReact makes this data flow explicit, but it requires a little more typing than two-way data binding. If you try to type or check the box in the example above, you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional. By writing <input value={filterText} />, you’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the filterText state passed in from FilterableProductTable. Since filterText state is never set, the input never changes.\n\nYou want to make it so whenever the user changes the form inputs, the state updates to reflect those changes. The state is owned by FilterableProductTable, so only it can call setFilterText and setInStockOnly. To let SearchBar update the FilterableProductTable’s state, you need to pass these functions down to SearchBar:\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');\n\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <SearchBar \n\n        filterText={filterText} \n\n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly}\n\n        onFilterTextChange={setFilterText}\n\n        onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly} />\n\nInside the SearchBar, you will add the onChange event handlers and set the parent state from them:\n\n<input \n\n  type=\"text\" \n\n  value={filterText} \n\n  placeholder=\"Search...\" \n\n  onChange={(e) => onFilterTextChange(e.target.value)} />\n\nNow the application fully works!\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction FilterableProductTable({ products }) {\n  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');\n  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SearchBar \n        filterText={filterText} \n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} \n        onFilterTextChange={setFilterText} \n        onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly} />\n      <ProductTable \n        products={products} \n        filterText={filterText}\n        inStockOnly={inStockOnly} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductCategoryRow({ category }) {\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <th colSpan=\"2\">\n        {category}\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductRow({ product }) {\n  const name = product.stocked ? product.name :\n    <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>\n      {product.name}\n    </span>;\n\n  return (\n    <tr>\n      <td>{name}</td>\n      <td>{product.price}</td>\n    </tr>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProductTable({ products, filterText, inStockOnly }) {\n  const rows = [];\n  let lastCategory = null;\n\n  products.forEach((product) => {\n    if (\n      product.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(\n        filterText.toLowerCase()\n      ) === -1\n    ) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (inStockOnly && !product.stocked) {\n      return;\n    }\n    if (product.category !== lastCategory) {\n      rows.push(\n        <ProductCategoryRow\n          category={product.category}\n          key={product.category} />\n      );\n    }\n    rows.push(\n      <ProductRow\n        product={product}\n        key={product.name} />\n    );\n    lastCategory = product.category;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Price</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>{rows}</tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction SearchBar({\n  filterText,\n  inStockOnly,\n  onFilterTextChange,\n  onInStockOnlyChange\n}) {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input \n        type=\"text\" \n        value={filterText} placeholder=\"Search...\" \n        onChange={(e) => onFilterTextChange(e.target.value)} />\n      <label>\n        <input \n          type=\"checkbox\" \n          checked={inStockOnly} \n          onChange={(e) => onInStockOnlyChange(e.target.checked)} />\n        {' '}\n        Only show products in stock\n      </label>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nconst PRODUCTS = [\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Apple\"},\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Dragonfruit\"},\n  {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$2\", stocked: false, name: \"Passionfruit\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$2\", stocked: true, name: \"Spinach\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$4\", stocked: false, name: \"Pumpkin\"},\n  {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Peas\"}\n];\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can learn all about handling events and updating state in the Adding Interactivity section.\n\nWhere to go from here \n\nThis was a very brief introduction to how to think about building components and applications with React.

    "html": "Quick Start\n\nWelcome to the React documentation! This page will give you an introduction to the 80% of React concepts that you will use on a daily basis.\n\nYou will learn\nHow to create and nest components\nHow to add markup and styles\nHow to display data\nHow to render conditions and lists\nHow to respond to events and update the screen\nHow to share data between components\nCreating and nesting components \n\nReact apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.\n\nReact components are JavaScript functions that return markup:\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <button>I'm a button</button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow that you’ve declared MyButton, you can nest it into another component:\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n\n      <MyButton />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNotice that <MyButton /> starts with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React component. React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.\n\nHave a look at the result:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction MyButton() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      I'm a button\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n      <MyButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe export default keywords specify the main component in the file. If you’re not familiar with some piece of JavaScript syntax, MDN and javascript.info have great references.\n\nWriting markup with JSX \n\nThe markup syntax you’ve seen above is called JSX. It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its convenience. All of the tools we recommend for local development support JSX out of the box.\n\nJSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:\n\nfunction AboutPage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <h1>About</h1>\n\n      <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf you have a lot of HTML to port to JSX, you can use an online converter.\n\nAdding styles \n\nIn React, you specify a CSS class with className. It works the same way as the HTML class attribute:\n\n<img className=\"avatar\" />\n\nThen you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:\n\n/* In your CSS */\n\n.avatar {\n\n  border-radius: 50%;\n\n}\n\nReact does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a <link> tag to your HTML. If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project.\n\nDisplaying data \n\nJSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user. For example, this will display user.name:\n\nreturn (\n\n  <h1>\n\n    {user.name}\n\n  </h1>\n\n);\n\nYou can also “escape into JavaScript” from JSX attributes, but you have to use curly braces instead of quotes. For example, className=\"avatar\" passes the \"avatar\" string as the CSS class, but src={user.imageUrl} reads the JavaScript user.imageUrl variable value, and then passes that value as the src attribute:\n\nreturn (\n\n  <img\n\n    className=\"avatar\"\n\n    src={user.imageUrl}\n\n  />\n\n);\n\nYou can put more complex expressions inside the JSX curly braces too, for example, string concatenation:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nconst user = {\n  name: 'Hedy Lamarr',\n  imageUrl: 'https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg',\n  imageSize: 90,\n};\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <img\n        className=\"avatar\"\n        src={user.imageUrl}\n        alt={'Photo of ' + user.name}\n        style={{\n          width: user.imageSize,\n          height: user.imageSize\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn the above example, style={{}} is not a special syntax, but a regular {} object inside the style={ } JSX curly braces. You can use the style attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.\n\nConditional rendering \n\nIn React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, you’ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX:\n\nlet content;\n\nif (isLoggedIn) {\n\n  content = <AdminPanel />;\n\n} else {\n\n  content = <LoginForm />;\n\n}\n\nreturn (\n\n  <div>\n\n    {content}\n\n  </div>\n\n);\n\nIf you prefer more compact code, you can use the conditional ? operator. Unlike if, it works inside JSX:\n\n<div>\n\n  {isLoggedIn ? (\n\n    <AdminPanel />\n\n  ) : (\n\n    <LoginForm />\n\n  )}\n\n</div>\n\nWhen you don’t need the else branch, you can also use a shorter logical && syntax:\n\n<div>\n\n  {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}\n\n</div>\n\nAll of these approaches also work for conditionally specifying attributes. If you’re unfamiliar with some of this JavaScript syntax, you can start by always using if...else.\n\nRendering lists \n\nYou will rely on JavaScript features like for loop and the array map() function to render lists of components.\n\nFor example, let’s say you have an array of products:\n\nconst products = [\n\n  { title: 'Cabbage', id: 1 },\n\n  { title: 'Garlic', id: 2 },\n\n  { title: 'Apple', id: 3 },\n\n];\n\nInside your component, use the map() function to transform an array of products into an array of <li> items:\n\nconst listItems = products.map(product =>\n\n  <li key={product.id}>\n\n    {product.title}\n\n  </li>\n\n);\n\n\n\nreturn (\n\n  <ul>{listItems}</ul>\n\n);\n\nNotice how <li> has a key attribute. For each item in a list, you should pass a string or a number that uniquely identifies that item among its siblings. Usually, a key should be coming from your data, such as a database ID. React uses your keys to know what happened if you later insert, delete, or reorder the items.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nconst products = [\n  { title: 'Cabbage', isFruit: false, id: 1 },\n  { title: 'Garlic', isFruit: false, id: 2 },\n  { title: 'Apple', isFruit: true, id: 3 },\n];\n\nexport default function ShoppingList() {\n  const listItems = products.map(product =>\n    <li\n      key={product.id}\n      style={{\n        color: product.isFruit ? 'magenta' : 'darkgreen'\n      }}\n    >\n      {product.title}\n    </li>\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <ul>{listItems}</ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nResponding to events \n\nYou can respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside your components:\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    alert('You clicked me!');\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n\n      Click me\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNotice how onClick={handleClick} has no parentheses at the end! Do not call the event handler function: you only need to pass it down. React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button.\n\nUpdating the screen \n\nOften, you’ll want your component to “remember” some information and display it. For example, maybe you want to count the number of times a button is clicked. To do this, add state to your component.\n\nFirst, import useState from React:\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nNow you can declare a state variable inside your component:\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  // ...\n\nYou’ll get two things from useState: the current state (count), and the function that lets you update it (setCount). You can give them any names, but the convention is to write [something, setSomething].\n\nThe first time the button is displayed, count will be 0 because you passed 0 to useState(). When you want to change state, call setCount() and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter:\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setCount(count + 1);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n\n      Clicked {count} times\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will call your component function again. This time, count will be 1. Then it will be 2. And so on.\n\nIf you render the same component multiple times, each will get its own state. Click each button separately:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>\n      <MyButton />\n      <MyButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      Clicked {count} times\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how each button “remembers” its own count state and doesn’t affect other buttons.\n\nUsing Hooks \n\nFunctions starting with use are called Hooks. useState is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.\n\nHooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.\n\nSharing data between components \n\nIn the previous example, each MyButton had its own independent count, and when each button was clicked, only the count for the button clicked changed:\n\nInitially, each MyButton’s count state is 0\n\nThe first MyButton updates its count to 1\n\nHowever, often you’ll need components to share data and always update together.\n\nTo make both MyButton components display the same count and update together, you need to move the state from the individual buttons “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them.\n\nIn this example, it is MyApp:\n\nInitially, MyApp’s count state is 0 and is passed down to both children\n\nOn click, MyApp updates its count state to 1 and passes it down to both children\n\nNow when you click either button, the count in MyApp will change, which will change both of the counts in MyButton. Here’s how you can express this in code.\n\nFirst, move the state up from MyButton into MyApp:\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setCount(count + 1);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>\n\n      <MyButton />\n\n      <MyButton />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\n  // ... we're moving code from here ...\n\n}\n\nThen, pass the state down from MyApp to each MyButton, together with the shared click handler. You can pass information to MyButton using the JSX curly braces, just like you previously did with built-in tags like <img>:\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setCount(count + 1);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <h1>Counters that update together</h1>\n\n      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n\n      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe information you pass down like this is called props. Now the MyApp component contains the count state and the handleClick event handler, and passes both of them down as props to each of the buttons.\n\nFinally, change MyButton to read the props you have passed from its parent component:\n\nfunction MyButton({ count, onClick }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n\n      Clicked {count} times\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWhen you click the button, the onClick handler fires. Each button’s onClick prop was set to the handleClick function inside MyApp, so the code inside of it runs. That code calls setCount(count + 1), incrementing the count state variable. The new count value is passed as a prop to each button, so they all show the new value. This is called “lifting state up”.

Extending PureComponent is equivalent to defining a custom shouldComponentUpdate method that shallowly compares props and state.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nUsage \nSkipping unnecessary re-renders for class components \n\nReact normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. As an optimization, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props and state are the same as the old props and state. Class components can opt into this behavior by extending PureComponent:\n\nclass Greeting extends PureComponent {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nA React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using PureComponent, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props and state haven’t changed. However, your component will still re-render if a context that it’s using changes.\n\nIn this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { PureComponent, useState } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends PureComponent {\n  render() {\n    console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n    return <h3>Hello{this.props.name && ', '}{this.props.name}!</h3>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes.

However, createFactory is deprecated, and you should not call createFactory in any new code. See how to migrate away from createFactory below.\n\nAlternatives \nCopying createFactory into your project \n\nIf your project has many createFactory calls, copy this createFactory.js implementation into your project:\n\nApp.js\ncreateFactory.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createFactory } from './createFactory.js';\n\nconst button = createFactory('button');\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return button({\n    onClick: () => {\n      alert('Clicked!')\n    }\n  }, 'Click me');\n}\n\n\n\nThis lets you keep all of your code unchanged except the imports.\n\nReplacing createFactory with createElement \n\nIf you have a few createFactory calls that you don’t mind porting manually, and you don’t want to use JSX, you can replace every call a factory function with a createElement call. For example, you can replace this code:\n\nimport { createFactory } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst button = createFactory('button');\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return button({\n\n    onClick: () => {\n\n      alert('Clicked!')\n\n    }\n\n  }, 'Click me');\n\n}\n\nwith this code:\n\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return createElement('button', {\n\n    onClick: () => {\n\n      alert('Clicked!')\n\n    }\n\n  }, 'Click me');\n\n}\n\nHere is a complete example of using React without JSX:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return createElement('button', {\n    onClick: () => {\n      alert('Clicked!')\n    }\n  }, 'Click me');\n}\n\n\nReplacing createFactory with JSX \n\nFinally, you can use JSX instead of createFactory. This is the most common way to use React:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      alert('Clicked!');\n    }}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  );\n};\n\n\nPitfall\n\nSometimes, your existing code might pass some variable as a type instead of a constant like 'button':\n\nfunction Heading({ isSubheading, ...props }) {\n\n  const type = isSubheading ? 'h2' : 'h1';\n\n  const factory = createFactory(type);\n\n  return factory(props);\n\n}\n\nTo do the same in JSX, you need to rename your variable to start with an uppercase letter like Type:\n\nfunction Heading({ isSubheading, ...props }) {\n\n  const Type = isSubheading ? 'h2' : 'h1';\n\n  return <Type {...props} />;\n\n}\n\nOtherwise React will interpret <type> as a built-in HTML tag because it is lowercase.\n\nPREVIOUS\ncreateElement\nNEXT\ncreateRef"

If you pass null, it will be treated the same as an empty object. React will create an element with props matching the props you have passed. Note that ref and key from your props object are special and will not be available as element.props.ref and element.props.key on the returned element. They will be available as element.ref and element.key.\n\noptional ...children: Zero or more child nodes.

If missing, null.\nkey: The key you have passed, coerced to a string. If missing, null.\n\nUsually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.\n\nCaveats \n\nYou must treat React elements and their props as immutable and never change their contents after creation. In development, React will freeze the returned element and its props property shallowly to enforce this.\n\nWhen you use JSX, you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component. In other words, <Something /> is equivalent to createElement(Something), but <something /> (lowercase) is equivalent to createElement('something') (note it’s a string, so it will be treated as a built-in HTML tag).\n\nYou should only pass children as multiple arguments to createElement if they are all statically known, like createElement('h1', {}, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: createElement('ul', {}, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.\n\nUsage \nCreating an element without JSX \n\nIf you don’t like JSX or can’t use it in your project, you can use createElement as an alternative.\n\nTo create an element without JSX, call createElement with some type, props, and children:\n\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return createElement(\n\n    'h1',\n\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n\n    'Hello ',\n\n    createElement('i', null, name),\n\n    '. Welcome!'\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe children are optional, and you can pass as many as you need (the example above has three children). This code will display a <h1> header with a greeting. For comparison, here is the same example rewritten with JSX:\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <h1 className=\"greeting\">\n\n      Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome!\n\n    </h1>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo render your own React component, pass a function like Greeting as the type instead of a string like 'h1':\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return createElement(Greeting, { name: 'Taylor' });\n\n}\n\nWith JSX, it would look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />;\n\n}\n\nHere is a complete example written with createElement:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return createElement(\n    'h1',\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n    'Hello ',\n    createElement('i', null, name),\n    '.

It is only available if you specify which context you want to receive using static contextType (modern) or static contextTypes (deprecated).\n\nA class component can only read one context at a time.\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    const theme = this.context;\n\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n\n    return (\n\n      <button className={className}>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n\n      </button>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\nNote\n\nReading this.context in class components is equivalent to useContext in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nprops \n\nThe props passed to a class component are available as this.props.\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\n<Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />\nNote\n\nReading this.props in class components is equivalent to declaring props in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nrefs \nDeprecated\n\nThis API will be removed in a future major version of React. Use createRef instead.\n\nLets you access legacy string refs for this component.\n\nstate \n\nThe state of a class component is available as this.state. The state field must be an object. Do not mutate the state directly. If you wish to change the state, call setState with the new state.\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    age: 42,\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  handleAgeChange = () => {\n\n    this.setState({\n\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n\n    });\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <>\n\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n\n        Increment age\n\n        </button>\n\n        <p>You are {this.state.age}.</p>\n\n      </>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\nNote\n\nDefining state in class components is equivalent to calling useState in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nconstructor(props) \n\nThe constructor runs before your class component mounts (gets added to the screen). Typically, a constructor is only used for two purposes in React. It lets you declare state and bind your class methods to the class instance:\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = { counter: 0 };\n\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  handleClick() {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\nIf you use modern JavaScript syntax, constructors are rarely needed. Instead, you can rewrite this code above using the public class field syntax which is supported both by modern browsers and tools like Babel:\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n\n  state = { counter: 0 };\n\n\n\n  handleClick = () => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\nA constructor should not contain any side effects or subscriptions.\n\nParameters \nprops: The component’s initial props.\nReturns \n\nconstructor should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nDo not run any side effects or subscriptions in the constructor. Instead, use componentDidMount for that.\n\nInside a constructor, you need to call super(props) before any other statement. If you don’t do that, this.props will be undefined while the constructor runs, which can be confusing and cause bugs.\n\nConstructor is the only place where you can assign this.state directly. In all other methods, you need to use this.setState() instead. Do not call setState in the constructor.\n\nWhen you use server rendering, the constructor will run on the server too, followed by the render method. However, lifecycle methods like componentDidMount or componentWillUnmount will not run on the server.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will call constructor twice in development and then throw away one of the instances. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the constructor.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no exact equivalent for constructor in function components. To declare state in a function component, call useState. To avoid recalculating the initial state, pass a function to useState.\n\ncomponentDidCatch(error, info) \n\nIf you define componentDidCatch, React will call it when some child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you log that error to an error reporting service in production.\n\nTypically, it is used together with static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. A component with these methods is called an error boundary.\n\nSee an example.\n\nParameters \n\nerror: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.\n\ninfo: An object containing additional information about the error. Its componentStack field contains a stack trace with the component that threw, as well as the names and source locations of all its parent components. In production, the component names will be minified. If you set up production error reporting, you can decode the component stack using sourcemaps the same way as you would do for regular JavaScript error stacks.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidCatch should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nIn the past, it was common to call setState inside componentDidCatch in order to update the UI and display the fallback error message. This is deprecated in favor of defining static getDerivedStateFromError.\n\nProduction and development builds of React slightly differ in the way componentDidCatch handles errors. In development, the errors will bubble up to window, which means that any window.onerror or window.addEventListener('error', callback) will intercept the errors that have been caught by componentDidCatch. In production, instead, the errors will not bubble up, which means any ancestor error handler will only receive errors not explicitly caught by componentDidCatch.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent for componentDidCatch in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, you can use the react-error-boundary package which does that for you.\n\ncomponentDidMount() \n\nIf you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. This is a common place to start data fetching, set up subscriptions, or manipulate the DOM nodes.\n\nIf you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement other lifecycle methods to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\ncomponentDidMount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidMount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development React will call componentDidMount, then immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\n\nAlthough you may call setState immediately in componentDidMount, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the constructor instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.\n\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot?) \n\nIf you define the componentDidUpdate method, React will call it immediately after your component has been re-rendered with updated props or state.  This method is not called for the initial render.\n\nYou can use it to manipulate the DOM after an update. This is also a common place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed). Typically, you’d use it together with componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount:\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\nprevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.\n\nprevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.\n\nsnapshot: If you implemented getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, snapshot will contain the value you returned from that method. Otherwise, it will be undefined.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidUpdate should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\ncomponentDidUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nThe logic inside componentDidUpdate should usually be wrapped in conditions comparing this.props with prevProps, and this.state with prevState. Otherwise, there’s a risk of creating infinite loops.\n\nAlthough you may call setState immediately in componentDidUpdate, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. This pattern often causes performance issues, but it may be necessary for rare cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.\n\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\ncomponentWillMount() \nDeprecated\n\nThis API has been renamed from componentWillMount to UNSAFE_componentWillMount.

The old name has been deprecated. In a future major version of React, only the new name will work.\n\nRun the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.\n\ncomponentWillUnmount() \n\nIf you define the componentWillUnmount method, React will call it before your component is removed (unmounted) from the screen. This is a common place to cancel data fetching or remove subscriptions.\n\nThe logic inside componentWillUnmount should “mirror” the logic inside componentDidMount. For example, if componentDidMount sets up a subscription, componentWillUnmount should clean up that subscription. If the cleanup logic in your componentWillUnmount reads some props or state, you will usually also need to implement componentDidUpdate to clean up resources (such as subscriptions) corresponding to the old props and state.\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\ncomponentWillUnmount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentWillUnmount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development React will call componentDidMount, then immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nforceUpdate(callback?) \n\nForces a component to re-render.\n\nUsually, this is not necessary. If your component’s render method only reads from this.props, this.state, or this.context, it will re-render automatically when you call setState inside your component or one of its parents. However, if your component’s render method reads directly from an external data source, you have to tell React to update the user interface when that data source changes. That’s what forceUpdate lets you do.\n\nTry to avoid all uses of forceUpdate and only read from this.props and this.state in render.\n\nParameters \noptional callback If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.\nReturns \n\nforceUpdate does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \nIf you call forceUpdate, React will re-render without calling shouldComponentUpdate.\nNote\n\nReading an external data source and forcing class components to re-render in response to its changes with forceUpdate has been superseded by useSyncExternalStore in function components.\n\ngetChildContext() \nDeprecated\n\nThis API will be removed in a future major version of React. Use Context.Provider instead.\n\nLets you specify the values for the legacy context is provided by this component.\n\ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) \n\nIf you implement getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, React will call it immediately before React updates the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate.\n\nFor example, you can use it in a UI like a chat thread that needs to preserve its scroll position during updates:\n\nclass ScrollingList extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.listRef = React.createRef();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    // Are we adding new items to the list?\n\n    // Capture the scroll position so we can adjust scroll later.\n\n    if (prevProps.list.length < this.props.list.length) {\n\n      const list = this.listRef.current;\n\n      return list.scrollHeight - list.scrollTop;\n\n    }\n\n    return null;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {\n\n    // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items.\n\n    // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view.\n\n    // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate)\n\n    if (snapshot !== null) {\n\n      const list = this.listRef.current;\n\n      list.scrollTop = list.scrollHeight - snapshot;\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <div ref={this.listRef}>{/* ...contents... */}</div>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, it is important to read the scrollHeight property directly in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate. It is not safe to read it in render, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, or UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate because there is a potential time gap between these methods getting called and React updating the DOM.\n\nParameters \n\nprevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.\n\nprevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.\n\nReturns \n\nYou should return a snapshot value of any type that you’d like, or null. The value you returned will be passed as the third argument to componentDidUpdate.\n\nCaveats \ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\nNote\n\nAt the moment, there is no equivalent to getSnapshotBeforeUpdate for function components. This use case is very uncommon, but if you have the need for it, for now you’ll have to write a class component.\n\nrender() \n\nThe render method is the only required method in a class component.\n\nThe render method should specify what you want to appear on the screen, for example:\n\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nReact may call render at any moment, so you shouldn’t assume that it runs at a particular time. Usually, the render method should return a piece of JSX, but a few other return types (like strings) are supported. To calculate the returned JSX, the render method can read this.props, this.state, and this.context.\n\nYou should write the render method as a pure function, meaning that it should return the same result if props, state, and context are the same. It also shouldn’t contain side effects (like setting up subscriptions) or interact with the browser APIs. Side effects should happen either in event handlers or methods like componentDidMount.\n\nParameters \n\nrender does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nrender can return any valid React node. This includes React elements such as <div />, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.\n\nCaveats \n\nrender should be written as a pure function of props, state, and context. It should not have side effects.\n\nrender will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will call render twice in development and then throw away one of the results. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the render method.\n\nThere is no one-to-one correspondence between the render call and the subsequent componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate call. Some of the render call results may be discarded by React when it’s beneficial.\n\nsetState(nextState, callback?) \n\nCall setState to update the state of your React component.\n\nclass Form extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    name: 'Taylor',\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n\n    const newName = e.target.value;\n\n    this.setState({\n\n      name: newName\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <>\n\n        <input value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleNameChange} />\n\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.</p>\n\n      </>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nsetState enqueues changes to the component state. It tells React that this component and its children need to re-render with the new state. This is the main way you’ll update the user interface in response to interactions.\n\nPitfall\n\nCalling setState does not change the current state in the already executing code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(this.state.name); // \"Taylor\"\n\n  this.setState({\n\n    name: 'Robin'\n\n  });\n\n  console.log(this.state.name); // Still \"Taylor\"!\n\n}\n\nIt only affects what this.state will return starting from the next render.\n\nYou can also pass a function to setState. It lets you update state based on the previous state:\n\n  handleIncreaseAge = () => {\n\n    this.setState(prevState => {\n\n      return {\n\n        age: prevState.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\nYou don’t have to do this, but it’s handy if you want to update state multiple times during the same event.\n\nParameters \n\nnextState: Either an object or a function.\n\nIf you pass an object as nextState, it will be shallowly merged into this.state.\nIf you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state and props as arguments, and should return the object to be shallowly merged into this.state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state.\n\noptional callback: If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.\n\nReturns \n\nsetState does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nThink of setState as a request rather than an immediate command to update the component. When multiple components update their state in response to an event, React will batch their updates and re-render them together in a single pass at the end of the event. In the rare case that you need to force a particular state update to be applied synchronously, you may wrap it in flushSync, but this may hurt performance.\n\nsetState does not update this.state immediately. This makes reading this.state right after calling setState a potential pitfall. Instead, use componentDidUpdate or the setState callback argument, either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, you can pass a function to nextState as described above.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState in class components is similar to calling a set function in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext) \n\nIf you define shouldComponentUpdate, React will call it to determine whether a re-render can be skipped.\n\nIf you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false to tell React the update can be skipped.\n\nclass Rectangle extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    isHovered: false\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      nextProps.position.x === this.props.position.x &&\n\n      nextProps.position.y === this.props.position.y &&\n\n      nextProps.size.width === this.props.size.width &&\n\n      nextProps.size.height === this.props.size.height &&\n\n      nextState.isHovered === this.state.isHovered\n\n    ) {\n\n      // Nothing has changed, so a re-render is unnecessary\n\n      return false;\n\n    }\n\n    return true;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReact calls shouldComponentUpdate before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true. This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate is used.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextState: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare nextState to this.state to determine what changed.\nnextContext: The next context that the component is about to render with. Compare nextContext to this.context to determine what changed. Only available if you specify static contextType (modern) or static contextTypes (legacy).\nReturns \n\nReturn true if you want the component to re-render. That’s the default behavior.\n\nReturn false to tell React that re-rendering can be skipped.\n\nCaveats \n\nThis method only exists as a performance optimization. If your component breaks without it, fix that first.\n\nConsider using PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate by hand. PureComponent shallowly compares props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update.\n\nWe do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify in shouldComponentUpdate. It makes performance unpredictable and dependent on the data structure of every prop and state. In the best case, you risk introducing multi-second stalls to your application, and in the worst case you risk crashing it.\n\nReturning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.\n\nReturning false does not guarantee that the component will not re-render. React will use the return value as a hint but it may still choose to re-render your component if it makes sense to do for other reasons.\n\nNote\n\nOptimizing class components with shouldComponentUpdate is similar to optimizing function components with memo. Function components also offer more granular optimization with useMemo.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount() \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillMount, React will call it immediately after the constructor. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nTo initialize state, declare state as a class field or set this.state inside the constructor.\nIf you need to run a side effect or set up a subscription, move that logic to componentDidMount instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillMount does not guarantee that the component will get mounted if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that relies on mounting (like adding a subscription) should go into componentDidMount.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount is the only lifecycle method that runs during server rendering. For all practical purposes, it is identical to constructor, so you should use the constructor for this type of logic instead.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState inside UNSAFE_componentWillMount in a class component to initialize state is equivalent to passing that state as the initial state to useState in a function component.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, React will call it when the component receives new props.

If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. By the time of the next render attempt, the props might be different. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that should run only for committed updates (like resetting a subscription) should go into componentDidUpdate.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps does not mean that the component has received different props than the last time. You need to compare nextProps and this.props yourself to check if something changed.\n\nReact doesn’t call UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps with initial props during mounting. It only calls this method if some of component’s props are going to be updated. For example, calling setState doesn’t generally trigger UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps inside the same component.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState inside UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in a class component to “adjust” state is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, React will call it before rendering with the new props or state. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nIf you need to run a side effect (for example, fetch data, run an animation, or reinitialize a subscription) in response to prop or state changes, move that logic to componentDidUpdate instead.\nIf you need to read some information from the DOM (for example, to save the current scroll position) so that you can use it in componentDidUpdate later, read it inside getSnapshotBeforeUpdate instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextState: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare nextState to this.state to determine what changed.\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nIt’s not supported to call setState (or any method that leads to setState being called, like dispatching a Redux action) during componentWillUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate does not guarantee that the component will update if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. By the time of the next render attempt, the props and state might be different. This is why this method is “unsafe”.

You need to compare nextProps with this.props and nextState with this.state yourself to check if something changed.\n\nReact doesn’t call UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate with initial props and state during mounting.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate in function components.\n\nstatic childContextTypes \nDeprecated\n\nThis API will be removed in a future major version of React. Use static contextType instead.\n\nLets you specify which legacy context is provided by this component.\n\nstatic contextTypes \nDeprecated\n\nThis API will be removed in a future major version of React. Use static contextType instead.\n\nLets you specify which legacy context is consumed by this component.\n\nstatic contextType \n\nIf you want to read this.context from your class component, you must specify which context it needs to read. The context you specify as the static contextType must be a value previously created by createContext.\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    const theme = this.context;\n\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n\n    return (\n\n      <button className={className}>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n\n      </button>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\nNote\n\nReading this.context in class components is equivalent to useContext in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nstatic defaultProps \n\nYou can define static defaultProps to set the default props for the class. They will be used for undefined and missing props, but not for null props.\n\nFor example, here is how you define that the color prop should default to 'blue':\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n\n  static defaultProps = {\n\n    color: 'blue'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <button className={this.props.color}>click me</button>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf the color prop is not provided or is undefined, it will be set by default to 'blue':\n\n<>\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */}\n\n  <Button />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */}\n\n  <Button color={undefined} />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is null */}\n\n  <Button color={null} />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"red\" */}\n\n  <Button color=\"red\" />\n\n</>\nNote\n\nDefining defaultProps in class components is similar to using default values in function components.\n\nstatic propTypes \n\nYou can define static propTypes together with the prop-types library to declare the types of the props accepted by your component. These types will be checked during rendering and in development only.\n\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\n\n\nclass Greeting extends React.Component {\n\n  static propTypes = {\n\n    name: PropTypes.string\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\nNote\n\nWe recommend using TypeScript instead of checking prop types at runtime.\n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError(error) \n\nIf you define static getDerivedStateFromError, React will call it when a child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you display an error message instead of clearing the UI.\n\nTypically, it is used together with componentDidCatch which lets you send the error report to some analytics service. A component with these methods is called an error boundary.\n\nSee an example.\n\nParameters \nerror: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.\nReturns \n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError should return the state telling the component to display the error message.\n\nCaveats \nstatic getDerivedStateFromError should be a pure function. If you want to perform a side effect (for example, to call an analytics service), you need to also implement componentDidCatch.\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent for static getDerivedStateFromError in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, use the react-error-boundary package which does that.\n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) \n\nIf you define static getDerivedStateFromProps, React will call it right before calling render, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.\n\nThis method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, this Form component resets the email state when the userID prop changes:\n\nclass Form extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    email: this.props.defaultEmail,\n\n    prevUserID: this.props.userID\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {\n\n    // Any time the current user changes,\n\n    // Reset any parts of state that are tied to that user.\n\n    // In this simple example, that's just the email.\n\n    if (props.userID !== state.prevUserID) {\n\n      return {\n\n        prevUserID: props.userID,\n\n        email: props.defaultEmail\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    return null;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNote that this pattern requires you to keep a previous value of the prop (like userID) in state (like prevUserID).\n\nPitfall\n\nDeriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives:\n\nIf you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate method instead.\nIf you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.\nIf you want to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.\nParameters \nprops: The next props that the component is about to render with.\nstate: The next state that the component is about to render with.\nReturns \n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.\n\nCaveats \n\nThis method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause. This is different from UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local setState.\n\nThis method doesn’t have access to the component instance. If you’d like, you can reuse some code between static getDerivedStateFromProps and the other class methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside the class definition.\n\nNote\n\nImplementing static getDerivedStateFromProps in a class component is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component.\n\nUsage \nDefining a class component \n\nTo define a React component as a class, extend the built-in Component class and define a render method:\n\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nReact will call your render method whenever it needs to figure out what to display on the screen. Usually, you will return some JSX from it. Your render method should be a pure function: it should only calculate the JSX.\n\nSimilarly to function components, a class component can receive information by props from its parent component. However, the syntax for reading props is different. For example, if the parent component renders <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />, then you can read the name prop from this.props, like this.props.name:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that Hooks (functions starting with use, like useState) are not supported inside class components.\n\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nAdding state to a class component \n\nTo add state to a class, assign an object to a property called state. To update state, call this.setState.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    name: 'Taylor',\n    age: 42,\n  };\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      name: e.target.value\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleAgeChange = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={this.state.name}\n          onChange={this.handleNameChange}\n        />\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n          Increment age\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}. You are {this.state.age}.</p>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nAdding lifecycle methods to a class component \n\nThere are a few special methods you can define on your class.\n\nIf you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. React will call componentDidUpdate after your component re-renders due to changed props or state. React will call componentWillUnmount after your component has been removed (unmounted) from the screen.\n\nIf you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement all three lifecycles to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.\n\nFor example, this ChatRoom component keeps a chat connection synchronized with props and state:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default class ChatRoom extends Component {\n  state = {\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setupConnection();\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n    if (\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n    ) {\n      this.destroyConnection();\n      this.setupConnection();\n    }\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.destroyConnection();\n  }\n\n  setupConnection() {\n    this.connection = createConnection(\n      this.state.serverUrl,\n      this.props.roomId\n    );\n    this.connection.connect();    \n  }\n\n  destroyConnection() {\n    this.connection.disconnect();\n    this.connection = null;\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <label>\n          Server URL:{' '}\n          <input\n            value={this.state.serverUrl}\n            onChange={e => {\n              this.setState({\n                serverUrl: e.target.value\n              });\n            }}\n          />\n        </label>\n        <h1>Welcome to the {this.props.roomId} room!</h1>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that in development when Strict Mode is on, React will call componentDidMount, immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\n\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nCatching rendering errors with an error boundary \n\nBy default, if your application throws an error during rendering, React will remove its UI from the screen. To prevent this, you can wrap a part of your UI into an error boundary. An error boundary is a special component that lets you display some fallback UI instead of the part that crashed—for example, an error message.\n\nTo implement an error boundary component, you need to provide static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. You can also optionally implement componentDidCatch to add some extra logic, for example, to log the error to an analytics service.\n\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n\n    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.\n\n    return { hasError: true };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n\n    // Example \"componentStack\":\n\n    //   in ComponentThatThrows (created by App)\n\n    //   in ErrorBoundary (created by App)\n\n    //   in div (created by App)\n\n    //   in App\n\n    logErrorToMyService(error, info.componentStack);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n\n      return this.props.fallback;\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    return this.props.children;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThen you can wrap a part of your component tree with it:\n\n<ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong</p>}>\n\n  <Profile />\n\n</ErrorBoundary>\n\nIf Profile or its child component throws an error, ErrorBoundary will “catch” that error, display a fallback UI with the error message you’ve provided, and send a production error report to your error reporting service.\n\nYou don’t need to wrap every component into a separate error boundary. When you think about the granularity of error boundaries, consider where it makes sense to display an error message. For example, in a messaging app, it makes sense to place an error boundary around the list of conversations. It also makes sense to place one around every individual message. However, it wouldn’t make sense to place a boundary around every avatar.\n\nNote\n\nThere is currently no way to write an error boundary as a function component. However, you don’t have to write the error boundary class yourself. For example, you can use react-error-boundary instead.\n\nAlternatives \nMigrating a simple component from a class to a function \n\nTypically, you will define components as functions instead.\n\nFor example, suppose you’re converting this Greeting class component to a function:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nDefine a function called Greeting. This is where you will move the body of your render function.\n\nfunction Greeting() {\n\n  // ... move the code from the render method here ...\n\n}\n\nInstead of this.props.name, define the name prop using the destructuring syntax and read it directly:\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\n}\n\nHere is a complete example:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nMigrating a component with state from a class to a function \n\nSuppose you’re converting this Counter class component to a function:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    name: 'Taylor',\n    age: 42,\n  };\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      name: e.target.value\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleAgeChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={this.state.name}\n          onChange={this.handleNameChange}\n        />\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n          Increment age\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.

In the above example, that’s true: it disconnects the connection that componentDidMount sets up. If such logic is missing, add it first.\n\nNext, verify that your componentDidUpdate method handles changes to any props and state you’re using in componentDidMount. In the above example, componentDidMount calls setupConnection which reads this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId. This is why componentDidUpdate checks whether this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId have changed, and resets the connection if they did. If your componentDidUpdate logic is missing or doesn’t handle changes to all relevant props and state, fix that first.\n\nIn the above example, the logic inside the lifecycle methods connects the component to a system outside of React (a chat server). To connect a component to an external system, describe this logic as a single Effect:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis useEffect call is equivalent to the logic in the lifecycle methods above. If your lifecycle methods do multiple unrelated things, split them into multiple independent Effects. Here is a complete example you can play with:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nIf your component does not synchronize with any external systems, you might not need an Effect.\n\nMigrating a component with context from a class to a function \n\nIn this example, the Panel and Button class components read context from this.context:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { createContext, Component } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nclass Panel extends Component {\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n  render() {\n    const theme = this.context;\n    const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <section className={className}>\n        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </section>\n    );    \n  }\n}\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n  render() {\n    const theme = this.context;\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <button className={className}>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you convert them to function components, replace this.context with useContext calls:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\ncloneElement\nNEXT\ncreateElement"

If omitted, it’s undefined.\nReturns \n\nIf children is null or undefined, returns the same value.\n\nOtherwise, returns a flat array consisting of the nodes you’ve returned from the fn function. The returned array will contain all nodes you returned except for null and undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nEmpty nodes (null, undefined, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and React elements count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. The traversal does not go deeper than React elements: they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. Fragments don’t get traversed.\n\nIf you return an element or an array of elements with keys from fn, the returned elements’ keys will be automatically combined with the key of the corresponding original item from children. When you return multiple elements from fn in an array, their keys only need to be unique locally amongst each other.\n\nChildren.only(children) \n\nCall Children.only(children) to assert that children represent a single React element.\n\nfunction Box({ children }) {\n\n  const element = Children.only(children);\n\n  // ...\nParameters \nchildren: The value of the children prop received by your component.\nReturns \n\nIf children is a valid element, returns that element.\n\nOtherwise, throws an error.\n\nCaveats \nThis method always throws if you pass an array (such as the return value of Children.map) as children. In other words, it enforces that children is a single React element, not that it’s an array with a single element.\nChildren.toArray(children) \n\nCall Children.toArray(children) to create an array out of the children data structure.\n\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function ReversedList({ children }) {\n\n  const result = Children.toArray(children);\n\n  result.reverse();\n\n  // ...\nParameters \nchildren: The value of the children prop received by your component.\nReturns \n\nReturns a flat array of elements in children.\n\nCaveats \nEmpty nodes (null, undefined, and Booleans) will be omitted in the returned array. The returned elements’ keys will be calculated from the original elements’ keys and their level of nesting and position. This ensures that flattening the array does not introduce changes in behavior.\nUsage \nTransforming children \n\nTo transform the children JSX that your component receives as the children prop, call Children.map:\n\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction RowList({ children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"RowList\">\n\n      {Children.map(children, child =>\n\n        <div className=\"Row\">\n\n          {child}\n\n        </div>\n\n      )}\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn the example above, the RowList wraps every child it receives into a <div className=\"Row\"> container. For example, let’s say the parent component passes three <p> tags as the children prop to RowList:\n\n<RowList>\n\n  <p>This is the first item.</p>\n\n  <p>This is the second item.</p>\n\n  <p>This is the third item.</p>\n\n</RowList>\n\nThen, with the RowList implementation above, the final rendered result will look like this:\n\n<div className=\"RowList\">\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the first item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the second item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the third item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n\nChildren.map is similar to to transforming arrays with map(). The difference is that the children data structure is considered opaque. This means that even if it’s sometimes an array, you should not assume it’s an array or any other particular data type. This is why you should use Children.map if you need to transform it.\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nexport default function RowList({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"RowList\">\n      {Children.map(children, child =>\n        <div className=\"Row\">\n          {child}\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy is the children prop not always an array? \nShow Details\nPitfall\n\nThe children data structure does not include rendered output of the components you pass as JSX. In the example below, the children received by the RowList only contains two items rather than three:\n\n<p>This is the first item.</p>\n<MoreRows />\n\nThis is why only two row wrappers are generated in this example:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport RowList from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      <MoreRows />\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MoreRows() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      <p>This is the third item.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThere is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component like <MoreRows /> when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.\n\nRunning some code for each child \n\nCall Children.forEach to iterate over each child in the children data structure. It does not return any value and is similar to the array forEach method. You can use it to run custom logic like constructing your own array.\n\nApp.js\nSeparatorList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nexport default function SeparatorList({ children }) {\n  const result = [];\n  Children.forEach(children, (child, index) => {\n    result.push(child);\n    result.push(<hr key={index} />);\n  });\n  result.pop(); // Remove the last separator\n  return result;\n}\n\n\nPitfall\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.\n\nCounting children \n\nCall Children.count(children) to calculate the number of children.\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nexport default function RowList({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"RowList\">\n      <h1 className=\"RowListHeader\">\n        Total rows: {Children.count(children)}\n      </h1>\n      {Children.map(children, child =>\n        <div className=\"Row\">\n          {child}\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.\n\nConverting children to an array \n\nCall Children.toArray(children) to turn the children data structure into a regular JavaScript array. This lets you manipulate the array with built-in array methods like filter, sort, or reverse.\n\nApp.js\nReversedList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nexport default function ReversedList({ children }) {\n  const result = Children.toArray(children);\n  result.reverse();\n  return result;\n}\n\n\nPitfall\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.\n\nAlternatives \nNote\n\nThis section describes alternatives to the Children API (with capital C) that’s imported like this:\n\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nDon’t confuse it with using the children prop (lowercase c), which is good and encouraged.\n\nExposing multiple components \n\nManipulating children with the Children methods often leads to fragile code. When you pass children to a component in JSX, you don’t usually expect the component to manipulate or transform the individual children.\n\nWhen you can, try to avoid using the Children methods. For example, if you want every child of RowList to be wrapped in <div className=\"Row\">, export a Row component, and manually wrap every row into it like this:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      </Row>\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nUnlike using Children.map, this approach does not wrap every child automatically. However, this approach has a significant benefit compared to the earlier example with Children.map because it works even if you keep extracting more components. For example, it still works if you extract your own MoreRows component:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <MoreRows />\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MoreRows() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      </Row>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis wouldn’t work with Children.map because it would “see” <MoreRows /> as a single child (and a single row).\n\nAccepting an array of objects as a prop \n\nYou can also explicitly pass an array as a prop. For example, this RowList accepts a rows array as a prop:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList rows={[\n      { id: 'first', content: <p>This is the first item.</p> },\n      { id: 'second', content: <p>This is the second item.</p> },\n      { id: 'third', content: <p>This is the third item.</p> }\n    ]} />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nSince rows is a regular JavaScript array, the RowList component can use built-in array methods like map on it.\n\nThis pattern is especially useful when you want to be able to pass more information as structured data together with children. In the below example, the TabSwitcher component receives an array of objects as the tabs prop:\n\nApp.js\nTabSwitcher.js\nReset\nFork\nimport TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <TabSwitcher tabs={[\n      {\n        id: 'first',\n        header: 'First',\n        content: <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      },\n      {\n        id: 'second',\n        header: 'Second',\n        content: <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      },\n      {\n        id: 'third',\n        header: 'Third',\n        content: <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      }\n    ]} />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nUnlike passing the children as JSX, this approach lets you associate some extra data like header with each item. Because you are working with the tabs directly, and it is an array, you do not need the Children methods.\n\nCalling a render prop to customize rendering \n\nInstead of producing JSX for every single item, you can also pass a function that returns JSX, and call that function when necessary. In this example, the App component passes a renderContent function to the TabSwitcher component. The TabSwitcher component calls renderContent only for the selected tab:\n\nApp.js\nTabSwitcher.js\nReset\nFork\nimport TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <TabSwitcher\n      tabIds={['first', 'second', 'third']}\n      getHeader={tabId => {\n        return tabId[0].toUpperCase() + tabId.slice(1);\n      }}\n      renderContent={tabId => {\n        return <p>This is the {tabId} item.</p>;\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nA prop like renderContent is called a render prop because it is a prop that specifies how to render a piece of the user interface. However, there is nothing special about it: it is a regular prop which happens to be a function.\n\nRender props are functions, so you can pass information to them. For example, this RowList component passes the id and the index of each row to the renderRow render prop, which uses index to highlight even rows:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList\n      rowIds={['first', 'second', 'third']}\n      renderRow={(id, index) => {\n        return (\n          <Row isHighlighted={index % 2 === 0}>\n            <p>This is the {id} item.</p>\n          </Row> \n        );\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is another example of how parent and child components can cooperate without manipulating the children.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI pass a custom component, but the Children methods don’t show its render result \n\nSuppose you pass two children to RowList like this:\n\n<RowList>\n\n  <p>First item</p>\n\n  <MoreRows />\n\n</RowList>\n\nIf you do Children.count(children) inside RowList, you will get 2. Even if MoreRows renders 10 different items, or if it returns null, Children.count(children) will still be 2. From the RowList’s perspective, it only “sees” the JSX it has received. It does not “see” the internals of the MoreRows component.\n\nThe limitation makes it hard to extract a component. This is why alternatives are preferred to using Children.\n\nPREVIOUS\nLegacy React APIs\nNEXT\ncloneElement"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nLEGACY REACT APIS\ncloneElement\nPitfall\n\nUsing cloneElement is uncommon and can lead to fragile code. See common alternatives.\n\ncloneElement lets you create a new React element using another element as a starting point.\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(element, props, ...children)\nReference\ncloneElement(element, props, ...children)\nUsage\nOverriding props of an element\nAlternatives\nPassing data with a render prop\nPassing data through context\nExtracting logic into a custom Hook\nReference \ncloneElement(element, props, ...children) \n\nCall cloneElement to create a React element based on the element, but with different props and children:\n\nimport { cloneElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\">\n\n    Hello\n\n  </Row>,\n\n  { isHighlighted: true },\n\n  'Goodbye'\n\n);\n\n\n\nconsole.log(clonedElement); // <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true}>Goodbye</Row>\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nelement: The element argument must be a valid React element. For example, it could be a JSX node like <Something />, the result of calling createElement, or the result of another cloneElement call.\n\nprops: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, the cloned element will retain all of the original element.props. Otherwise, for every prop in the props object, the returned element will “prefer” the value from props over the value from element.props. The rest of the props will be filled from the original element.props. If you pass props.key or props.ref, they will replace the original ones.\n\noptional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes. If you don’t pass any ...children arguments, the original element.props.children will be preserved.\n\nReturns \n\ncloneElement returns a React element object with a few properties:\n\ntype: Same as element.type.\nprops: The result of shallowly merging element.props with the overriding props you have passed.\nref: The original element.ref, unless it was overridden by props.ref.\nkey: The original element.key, unless it was overridden by props.key.\n\nUsually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.\n\nCaveats \n\nCloning an element does not modify the original element.\n\nYou should only pass children as multiple arguments to cloneElement if they are all statically known, like cloneElement(element, null, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: cloneElement(element, null, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.\n\ncloneElement makes it harder to trace the data flow, so try the alternatives instead.\n\nUsage \nOverriding props of an element \n\nTo override the props of some React element, pass it to cloneElement with the props you want to override:\n\nimport { cloneElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\" />,\n\n  { isHighlighted: true }\n\n);\n\nHere, the resulting cloned element will be <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true} />.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when it’s useful.\n\nImagine a List component that renders its children as a list of selectable rows with a “Next” button that changes which row is selected. The List component needs to render the selected Row differently, so it clones every <Row> child that it has received, and adds an extra isHighlighted: true or isHighlighted: false prop:\n\nexport default function List({ children }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {Children.map(children, (child, index) =>\n\n        cloneElement(child, {\n\n          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex \n\n        })\n\n      )}\n\nLet’s say the original JSX received by List looks like this:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\" />\n\n  <Row title=\"Garlic\" />\n\n  <Row title=\"Apple\" />\n\n</List>\n\nBy cloning its children, the List can pass extra information to every Row inside. The result looks like this:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Cabbage\"\n\n    isHighlighted={true} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Garlic\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Apple\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n</List>\n\nNotice how pressing “Next” updates the state of the List, and highlights a different row:\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Children, cloneElement, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function List({ children }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {Children.map(children, (child, index) =>\n        cloneElement(child, {\n          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex \n        })\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % Children.count(children)\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo summarize, the List cloned the <Row /> elements it received and added an extra prop to them.\n\nPitfall\n\nCloning children makes it hard to tell how the data flows through your app. Try one of the alternatives.\n\nAlternatives \nPassing data with a render prop \n\nInstead of using cloneElement, consider accepting a render prop like renderItem. Here, List receives renderItem as a prop. List calls renderItem for every item and passes isHighlighted as an argument:\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n\n        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);\n\n      })}\n\nThe renderItem prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a renderItem implementation that renders a <Row> with the given isHighlighted value:\n\n<List\n\n  items={products}\n\n  renderItem={(product, isHighlighted) =>\n\n    <Row\n\n      key={product.id}\n\n      title={product.title}\n\n      isHighlighted={isHighlighted}\n\n    />\n\n  }\n\n/>\n\nThe end result is the same as with cloneElement:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Cabbage\"\n\n    isHighlighted={true} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Garlic\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Apple\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n</List>\n\nHowever, you can clearly trace where the isHighlighted value is coming from.\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);\n      })}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % items.length\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis pattern is preferred to cloneElement because it is more explicit.\n\nPassing data through context \n\nAnother alternative to cloneElement is to pass data through context.\n\nFor example, you can call createContext to define a HighlightContext:\n\nexport const HighlightContext = createContext(false);\n\nYour List component can wrap every item it renders into a HighlightContext provider:\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n\n        return (\n\n          <HighlightContext.Provider key={item.id} value={isHighlighted}>\n\n            {renderItem(item)}\n\n          </HighlightContext.Provider>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\nWith this approach, Row does not need to receive an isHighlighted prop at all. Instead, it reads the context:\n\nexport default function Row({ title }) {\n\n  const isHighlighted = useContext(HighlightContext);\n\n  // ...\n\nThis allows the calling component to not know or worry about passing isHighlighted to <Row>:\n\n<List\n\n  items={products}\n\n  renderItem={product =>\n\n    <Row title={product.title} />\n\n  }\n\n/>\n\nInstead, List and Row coordinate the highlighting logic through context.\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\nHighlightContext.js\ndata.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { HighlightContext } from './HighlightContext.js';\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n        return (\n          <HighlightContext.Provider\n            key={item.id}\n            value={isHighlighted}\n          >\n            {renderItem(item)}\n          </HighlightContext.Provider>\n        );\n      })}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % items.length\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nLearn more about passing data through context.\n\nExtracting logic into a custom Hook \n\nAnother approach you can try is to extract the “non-visual” logic into your own Hook, and use the information returned by your Hook to decide what to render. For example, you could write a useList custom Hook like this:\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function useList(items) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  function onNext() {\n\n    setSelectedIndex(i =>\n\n      (i + 1) % items.length\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  const selected = items[selectedIndex];\n\n  return [selected, onNext];\n\n}\n\nThen you could use it like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {products.map(product =>\n\n        <Row\n\n          key={product.id}\n\n          title={product.title}\n\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n\n        />\n\n      )}\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n\n        Next\n\n      </button>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe data flow is explicit, but the state is inside the useList custom Hook that you can use from any component:\n\nApp.js\nuseList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReset\nFork\nimport Row from './Row.js';\nimport useList from './useList.js';\nimport { products } from './data.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {products.map(product =>\n        <Row\n          key={product.id}\n          title={product.title}\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n        />\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis approach is particularly useful if you want to reuse this logic between different components.\n\nPREVIOUS\nChildren\nNEXT\nComponent"

Instead, renderToString will find the closest <Suspense> boundary above it and render its fallback prop in the HTML. The content will not appear until the client code loads.\n\nTo solve this, use one of the recommended streaming solutions. They can stream content in chunks as it resolves on the server so that the user sees the page being progressively filled in before the client code loads.\n\nPREVIOUS\nrenderToStaticNodeStream"

Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.\n\nFor example, it might look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <html>\n\n      <head>\n\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link>\n\n        <title>My app</title>\n\n      </head>\n\n      <body>\n\n        <Router />\n\n      </body>\n\n    </html>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html>\n\n  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... -->\n\n</html>\n\n<script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n\nOn the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\n\nThis will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nReading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output \nShow Details\nStreaming more content as it loads \n\nStreaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Posts />\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nImagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (PostsGlimmer) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer, later replaced by the Posts.\n\nYou can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar, Friends, or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.\n\nStreaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the <script> tags load.\n\nRead more about how streaming HTML works.\n\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nSpecifying what goes into the shell \n\nThe part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIt determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:\n\n<ProfileLayout>\n\n  <ProfileCover />\n\n  <BigSpinner />\n\n</ProfileLayout>\n\nIf you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.\n\nThe async call to renderToReadableStream will resolve to a stream as soon as the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then by creating and returning a response with that stream:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']\n\n  });\n\n  return new Response(stream, {\n\n    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nBy the time the stream is returned, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data.\n\nLogging crashes on the server \n\nBy default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n    onError(error) {\n\n      console.error(error);\n\n      logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n  return new Response(stream, {\n\n    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nIf you provide a custom onError implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.\n\nRecovering from errors inside the shell \n\nIn this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout, ProfileCover, and PostsGlimmer:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Wrap your renderToReadableStream call in a try...catch to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and your catch block will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use the catch block to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.\n\nRecovering from errors outside the shell \n\nIn this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it:\n\nIt will emit the loading fallback for the closest <Suspense> boundary (PostsGlimmer) into the HTML.\nIt will “give up” on trying to render the Posts content on the server anymore.\nWhen the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will retry rendering Posts on the client.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.\n\nSetting the status code \n\nStreaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.\n\nBy dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, your catch block will run which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: 200,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but your code will continue running without getting into the catch block. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above.\n\nHowever, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    let didError = false;\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: didError ? 500 : 200,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThis will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.\n\nHandling different errors in different ways \n\nYou can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then you can save the error in onError and do something different before returning the response depending on the error type:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  let didError = false;\n\n  let caughtError = null;\n\n\n\n  function getStatusCode() {\n\n    if (didError) {\n\n      if (caughtError instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\n        return 404;\n\n      } else {\n\n        return 500;\n\n      }\n\n    } else {\n\n      return 200;\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  try {\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        caughtError = error;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: getStatusCode(),\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: getStatusCode(),\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nKeep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.\n\nWaiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation \n\nStreaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.\n\nHowever, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.\n\nYou can wait for all the content to load by awaiting the stream.allReady Promise:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    let didError = false;\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    let isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ...\n\n    if (isCrawler) {\n\n      await stream.allReady;\n\n    }\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: didError ? 500 : 200,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nA regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.\n\nAborting server rendering \n\nYou can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    const controller = new AbortController();\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n\n      controller.abort();\n\n    }, 10000);\n\n\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      signal: controller.signal,\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    // ...\n\nReact will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.\n\nPREVIOUS\nrenderToPipeableStream\nNEXT\nrenderToStaticMarkup"

Environments with Web Streams, like Deno and modern edge runtimes, should use renderToReadableStream instead.\n\nReference \nrenderToPipeableStream(reactNode, options?) \n\nCall renderToPipeableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Node.js Stream.\n\nimport { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server';\n\n\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nOn the client, call hydrateRoot to make the server-generated HTML interactive.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nreactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.\n\noptional options: An object with streaming options.\n\noptional bootstrapScriptContent: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag.\noptional bootstrapScripts: An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot. Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.\noptional bootstrapModules: Like bootstrapScripts, but emits <script type=\"module\"> instead.\noptional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to hydrateRoot.\noptional namespaceURI: A string with the root namespace URI for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' for SVG or 'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' for MathML.\noptional nonce: A nonce string to allow scripts for script-src Content-Security-Policy.\noptional onAllReady: A callback that fires when all rendering is complete, including both the shell and all additional content. You can use this instead of onShellReady for crawlers and static generation. If you start streaming here, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML.\noptional onError: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether recoverable or not. By default, this only calls console.error. If you override it to log crash reports, make sure that you still call console.error. You can also use it to adjust the status code before the shell is emitted.\noptional onShellReady: A callback that fires right after the initial shell has been rendered. You can set the status code and call pipe here to start streaming. React will stream the additional content after the shell along with the inline <script> tags that place that replace the HTML loading fallbacks with the content.\noptional onShellError: A callback that fires if there was an error rendering the initial shell. It receives the error as an argument. No bytes were emitted from the stream yet, and neither onShellReady nor onAllReady will get called, so you can output a fallback HTML shell.\noptional progressiveChunkSize: The number of bytes in a chunk. Read more about the default heuristic.\nReturns \n\nrenderToPipeableStream returns an object with two methods:\n\npipe outputs the HTML into the provided Writable Node.js Stream. Call pipe in onShellReady if you want to enable streaming, or in onAllReady for crawlers and static generation.\nabort lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client.\nUsage \nRendering a React tree as HTML to a Node.js Stream \n\nCall renderToPipeableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Node.js Stream:\n\nimport { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server';\n\n\n\n// The route handler syntax depends on your backend framework\n\napp.use('/', (request, response) => {\n\n  const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n    onShellReady() {\n\n      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n      pipe(response);\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n});\n\nAlong with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths. Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.\n\nFor example, it might look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <html>\n\n      <head>\n\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link>\n\n        <title>My app</title>\n\n      </head>\n\n      <body>\n\n        <Router />\n\n      </body>\n\n    </html>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html>\n\n  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... -->\n\n</html>\n\n<script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n\nOn the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\n\nThis will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nReading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output \nShow Details\nStreaming more content as it loads \n\nStreaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Posts />\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nImagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (PostsGlimmer) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer, later replaced by the Posts.\n\nYou can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar, Friends, or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.\n\nStreaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the <script> tags load.\n\nRead more about how streaming HTML works.\n\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nSpecifying what goes into the shell \n\nThe part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIt determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:\n\n<ProfileLayout>\n\n  <ProfileCover />\n\n  <BigSpinner />\n\n</ProfileLayout>\n\nIf you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.\n\nThe onShellReady callback fires when the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then:\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nBy the time onShellReady fires, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data.\n\nLogging crashes on the server \n\nBy default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nIf you provide a custom onError implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.\n\nRecovering from errors inside the shell \n\nIn this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout, ProfileCover, and PostsGlimmer:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Override onShellError to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nIf there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and onShellError will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use onShellError to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.\n\nRecovering from errors outside the shell \n\nIn this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it:\n\nIt will emit the loading fallback for the closest <Suspense> boundary (PostsGlimmer) into the HTML.\nIt will “give up” on trying to render the Posts content on the server anymore.\nWhen the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will retry rendering Posts on the client.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.\n\nSetting the status code \n\nStreaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.\n\nBy dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, you’ll get the onShellError callback which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.statusCode = 200;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nIf a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but you will still get onShellReady instead of onShellError. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above.\n\nHowever, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:\n\nlet didError = false;\n\n\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    didError = true;\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nThis will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.\n\nHandling different errors in different ways \n\nYou can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then your onError, onShellReady, and onShellError callbacks can do something different depending on the error type:\n\nlet didError = false;\n\nlet caughtError = null;\n\n\n\nfunction getStatusCode() {\n\n  if (didError) {\n\n    if (caughtError instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\n      return 404;\n\n    } else {\n\n      return 500;\n\n    }\n\n  } else {\n\n    return 200;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.statusCode = getStatusCode();\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n   response.statusCode = getStatusCode();\n\n   response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n   response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    didError = true;\n\n    caughtError = error;\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nKeep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.\n\nWaiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation \n\nStreaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.\n\nHowever, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.\n\nYou can wait for all the content to load using the onAllReady callback:\n\nlet didError = false;\n\nlet isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ...\n\n\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    if (!isCrawler) {\n\n      response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;\n\n      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n      pipe(response);\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onAllReady() {\n\n    if (isCrawler) {\n\n      response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;\n\n      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n      pipe(response);      \n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    didError = true;\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nA regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.\n\nAborting server rendering \n\nYou can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:\n\nconst { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n\n  abort();\n\n}, 10000);\n\nReact will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.\n\nPREVIOUS\nrenderToNodeStream\nNEXT\nrenderToReadableStream"

An app fully built with React will usually only have one hydrateRoot call with its root component.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\ndomNode: A DOM element that was rendered as the root element on the server.\n\nreactNode: The “React node” used to render the existing HTML. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> which was rendered with a ReactDOM Server method such as renderToPipeableStream(<App />).\n\noptional options: An object with options for this React root.\n\noptional onRecoverableError: Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors.\noptional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as used on the server.\nReturns \n\nhydrateRoot returns an object with two methods: render and unmount.\n\nCaveats \nhydrateRoot() expects the rendered content to be identical with the server-rendered content. You should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them.\nIn development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.\nYou’ll likely have only one hydrateRoot call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.\nIf your app is client-rendered with no HTML rendered already, using hydrateRoot() is not supported. Use createRoot() instead.\nroot.render(reactNode) \n\nCall root.render to update a React component inside a hydrated React root for a browser DOM element.\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nReact will update <App /> in the hydrated root.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nreactNode: A “React node” that you want to update. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App />, but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement(), a string, a number, null, or undefined.\nReturns \n\nroot.render returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \nIf you call root.render before the root has finished hydrating, React will clear the existing server-rendered HTML content and switch the entire root to client rendering.\nroot.unmount() \n\nCall root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.\n\nroot.unmount();\n\nAn app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount.\n\nThis is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. You need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount. Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t clean up and free up resources like subscriptions.\n\nCalling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree.\n\nParameters \n\nroot.unmount does not accept any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nroot.unmount returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nCalling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.\n\nOnce you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error.\n\nUsage \nHydrating server-rendered HTML \n\nIf your app’s HTML was generated by react-dom/server, you need to hydrate it on the client.\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);\n\nThis will hydrate the server HTML inside the browser DOM node with the React component for your app. Usually, you will do it once at startup. If you use a framework, it might do this behind the scenes for you.\n\nTo hydrate your app, React will “attach” your components’ logic to the initial generated HTML from the server. Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot from the server into a fully interactive app that runs in the browser.\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport './styles.css';\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport App from './App.js';\n\nhydrateRoot(\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n  <App />\n);\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t need to call hydrateRoot again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state instead.\n\nPitfall\n\nThe React tree you pass to hydrateRoot needs to produce the same output as it did on the server.\n\nThis is important for the user experience. The user will spend some time looking at the server-generated HTML before your JavaScript code loads. Server rendering creates an illusion that the app loads faster by showing the HTML snapshot of its output. Suddenly showing different content breaks that illusion. This is why the server render output must match the initial render output on the client.\n\nThe most common causes leading to hydration errors include:\n\nExtra whitespace (like newlines) around the React-generated HTML inside the root node.\nUsing checks like typeof window !== 'undefined' in your rendering logic.\nUsing browser-only APIs like window.matchMedia in your rendering logic.\nRendering different data on the server and the client.\n\nReact recovers from some hydration errors, but you must fix them like other bugs. In the best case, they’ll lead to a slowdown; in the worst case, event handlers can get attached to the wrong elements.\n\nHydrating an entire document \n\nApps fully built with React can render the entire document as JSX, including the <html> tag:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <html>\n\n      <head>\n\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link>\n\n        <title>My app</title>\n\n      </head>\n\n      <body>\n\n        <Router />\n\n      </body>\n\n    </html>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo hydrate the entire document, pass the document global as the first argument to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\nSuppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors \n\nIf a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning.\n\nTo silence hydration warnings on an element, add suppressHydrationWarning={true}:\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <h1 suppressHydrationWarning={true}>\n      Current Date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates.\n\nHandling different client and server content \n\nIf you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like isClient, which you can set to true in an Effect:\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setIsClient(true);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <h1>\n      {isClient ? 'Is Client' : 'Is Server'}\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.\n\nPitfall\n\nThis approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may also feel jarring to the user.\n\nUpdating a hydrated root component \n\nAfter the root has finished hydrating, you can call root.render to update the root React component. Unlike with createRoot, you don’t usually need to do this because the initial content was already rendered as HTML.\n\nIf you call root.render at some point after hydration, and the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive:\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport App from './App.js';\n\nconst root = hydrateRoot(\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n  <App counter={0} />\n);\n\nlet i = 0;\nsetInterval(() => {\n  root.render(<App counter={i} />);\n  i++;\n}, 1000);\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to call root.render on a hydrated root. Usually, you’ll update state inside one of the components instead.\n\nPREVIOUS\ncreateRoot\nNEXT\nServer APIs"

In that case, you need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount. Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t know to clean up and free up global resources like subscriptions.\n\nCalling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree.\n\nParameters \n\nroot.unmount does not accept any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nroot.unmount returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nCalling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.\n\nOnce you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the same root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error. However, you can create a new root for the same DOM node after the previous root for that node has been unmounted.\n\nUsage \nRendering an app fully built with React \n\nIf your app is fully built with React, create a single root for your entire app.\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nUsually, you only need to run this code once at startup. It will:\n\nFind the browser DOM node defined in your HTML.\nDisplay the React component for your app inside.\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport App from './App.js';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n\n\nIf your app is fully built with React, you shouldn’t need to create any more roots, or to call root.render again.\n\nFrom this point on, React will manage the DOM of your entire app. To add more components, nest them inside the App component. When you need to update the UI, each of your components can do this by using state. When you need to display extra content like a modal or a tooltip outside the DOM node, render it with a portal.\n\nNote\n\nWhen your HTML is empty, the user sees a blank page until the app’s JavaScript code loads and runs:\n\n<div id=\"root\"></div>\n\nThis can feel very slow! To solve this, you can generate the initial HTML from your components on the server or during the build. Then your visitors can read text, see images, and click links before any of the JavaScript code loads. We recommend using a framework that does this optimization out of the box. Depending on when it runs, this is called server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).\n\nPitfall\n\nApps using server rendering or static generation must call hydrateRoot instead of createRoot. React will then hydrate (reuse) the DOM nodes from your HTML instead of destroying and re-creating them.\n\nRendering a page partially built with React \n\nIf your page isn’t fully built with React, you can call createRoot multiple times to create a root for each top-level piece of UI managed by React. You can display different content in each root by calling root.render.\n\nHere, two different React components are rendered into two DOM nodes defined in the index.html file:\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nComponents.js\nReset\nFork\nimport './styles.css';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport { Comments, Navigation } from './Components.js';\n\nconst navDomNode = document.getElementById('navigation');\nconst navRoot = createRoot(navDomNode); \nnavRoot.render(<Navigation />);\n\nconst commentDomNode = document.getElementById('comments');\nconst commentRoot = createRoot(commentDomNode); \ncommentRoot.render(<Comments />);\n\n\n\nYou could also create a new DOM node with document.createElement() and add it to the document manually.\n\nconst domNode = document.createElement('div');\n\nconst root = createRoot(domNode); \n\nroot.render(<Comment />);\n\ndocument.body.appendChild(domNode); // You can add it anywhere in the document\n\nTo remove the React tree from the DOM node and clean up all the resources used by it, call root.unmount.\n\nroot.unmount();\n\nThis is mostly useful if your React components are inside an app written in a different framework.\n\nUpdating a root component \n\nYou can call render more than once on the same root. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport App from './App.js';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nlet i = 0;\nsetInterval(() => {\n  root.render(<App counter={i} />);\n  i++;\n}, 1000);\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to call render multiple times. Usually, your components will update state instead.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’ve created a root, but nothing is displayed \n\nMake sure you haven’t forgotten to actually render your app into the root:\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nUntil you do that, nothing is displayed.\n\nI’m getting an error: “Target container is not a DOM element” \n\nThis error means that whatever you’re passing to createRoot is not a DOM node.\n\nIf you’re not sure what’s happening, try logging it:\n\nconst domNode = document.getElementById('root');\n\nconsole.log(domNode); // ???\n\nconst root = createRoot(domNode);\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nFor example, if domNode is null, it means that getElementById returned null. This will happen if there is no node in the document with the given ID at the time of your call. There may be a few reasons for it:\n\nThe ID you’re looking for might differ from the ID you used in the HTML file. Check for typos!\nYour bundle’s <script> tag cannot “see” any DOM nodes that appear after it in the HTML.\n\nAnother common way to get this error is to write createRoot(<App />) instead of createRoot(domNode).\n\nI’m getting an error: “Functions are not valid as a React child.” \n\nThis error means that whatever you’re passing to root.render is not a React component.\n\nThis may happen if you call root.render with Component instead of <Component />:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: App is a function, not a Component.\n\nroot.render(App);\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: <App /> is a component.\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nOr if you pass a function to root.render, instead of the result of calling it:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: createApp is a function, not a component.\n\nroot.render(createApp);\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: call createApp to return a component.\n\nroot.render(createApp());\nMy server-rendered HTML gets re-created from scratch \n\nIf your app is server-rendered and includes the initial HTML generated by React, you might notice that creating a root and calling root.render deletes all that HTML, and then re-creates all the DOM nodes from scratch. This can be slower, resets focus and scroll positions, and may lose other user input.\n\nServer-rendered apps must use hydrateRoot instead of createRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(\n\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n\n  <App />\n\n);\n\nNote that its API is different. In particular, usually there will be no further root.render call.\n\nPREVIOUS\nClient APIs\nNEXT\nhydrateRoot"

React can patch up differences in text content, but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them.\nIn development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.\nYou’ll likely have only one hydrate call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.\nIf your app is client-rendered with no HTML rendered already, using hydrate() is not supported. Use render() (for React 17 and below) or createRoot() (for React 18+) instead.\nUsage \n\nCall hydrate to attach a React component into a server-rendered browser DOM node.\n\nimport { hydrate } from 'react-dom';\n\n\n\nhydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n\nUsing hydrate() to render a client-only app (an app without server-rendered HTML) is not supported. Use render() (in React 17 and below) or createRoot() (in React 18+) instead.\n\nHydrating server-rendered HTML \n\nIn React, “hydration” is how React “attaches” to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment. During hydration, React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup and take over rendering the app on the client.\n\nIn apps fully built with React, you will usually only hydrate one “root”, once at startup for your entire app.\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport './styles.css';\nimport { hydrate } from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App.js';\n\nhydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n\n\n\nUsually you shouldn’t need to call hydrate again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state.\n\nFor more information on hydration, see the docs for hydrateRoot.\n\nSuppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors \n\nIf a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning.\n\nTo silence hydration warnings on an element, add suppressHydrationWarning={true}:\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <h1 suppressHydrationWarning={true}>\n      Current Date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates.\n\nHandling different client and server content \n\nIf you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like isClient, which you can set to true in an effect:\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setIsClient(true);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <h1>\n      {isClient ? 'Is Client' : 'Is Server'}\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.\n\nPitfall\n\nThis approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may feel jarring to the user.\n\nPREVIOUS\nfindDOMNode\nNEXT\nrender"

When a component renders to null, or renders false, findDOMNode returns null. When a component renders to a string, findDOMNode returns a text DOM node containing that value.\n\nCaveats \n\nA component may return an array or a Fragment with multiple children. In that case findDOMNode, will return the DOM node corresponding to the first non-empty child.\n\nfindDOMNode only works on mounted components (that is, components that have been placed in the DOM). If you try to call this on a component that has not been mounted yet (like calling findDOMNode() in render() on a component that has yet to be created), an exception will be thrown.\n\nfindDOMNode only returns the result at the time of your call.

This lets you do something with it. For example, when clicking “Show example” below mounts the input, input.select() selects all text in the input:\n\nApp.js\nAutoselectingInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\nimport { findDOMNode } from 'react-dom';\n\nclass AutoselectingInput extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    const input = findDOMNode(this);\n    input.select()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <input defaultValue=\"Hello\" />\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AutoselectingInput;\n\n\nAlternatives \nReading component’s own DOM node from a ref \n\nCode using findDOMNode is fragile because the connection between the JSX node and the code manipulating the corresponding DOM node is not explicit. For example, try wrapping this <input /> into a <div>:\n\nApp.js\nAutoselectingInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\nimport { findDOMNode } from 'react-dom';\n\nclass AutoselectingInput extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    const input = findDOMNode(this);\n    input.select()\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <input defaultValue=\"Hello\" />\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AutoselectingInput;\n\n\n\nThis will break the code because now, findDOMNode(this) finds the <div> DOM node, but the code expects an <input> DOM node. To avoid these kinds of problems, use createRef to manage a specific DOM node.\n\nIn this example, findDOMNode is no longer used. Instead, inputRef = createRef(null) is defined as an instance field on the class. To read the DOM node from it, you can use this.inputRef.current. To attach it to the JSX, you render <input ref={this.inputRef} />. This connects the code using the DOM node to its JSX:\n\nApp.js\nAutoselectingInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createRef, Component } from 'react';\n\nclass AutoselectingInput extends Component {\n  inputRef = createRef(null);\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    const input = this.inputRef.current;\n    input.select()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <input ref={this.inputRef} defaultValue=\"Hello\" />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AutoselectingInput;\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn modern React without class components, the equivalent code would call useRef instead:\n\nApp.js\nAutoselectingInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function AutoselectingInput() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const input = inputRef.current;\n    input.select();\n  }, []);\n\n  return <input ref={inputRef} defaultValue=\"Hello\" />\n}\n\n\n\nRead more about manipulating the DOM with refs.\n\nReading a child component’s DOM node from a forwarded ref \n\nIn this example, findDOMNode(this) finds a DOM node that belongs to another component. The AutoselectingInput renders MyInput, which is your own component that renders a browser <input>.\n\nApp.js\nAutoselectingInput.js\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\nimport { findDOMNode } from 'react-dom';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nclass AutoselectingInput extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    const input = findDOMNode(this);\n    input.select()\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <MyInput />;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AutoselectingInput;\n\n\n\nNotice that calling findDOMNode(this) inside AutoselectingInput still gives you the DOM <input>—even though the JSX for this <input> is hidden inside the MyInput component. This seems convenient for the above example, but it leads to fragile code. Imagine that you wanted to edit MyInput later and add a wrapper <div> around it. This would break the code of AutoselectingInput (which expects to find an <input>).\n\nTo replace findDOMNode in this example, the two components need to coordinate:\n\nAutoSelectingInput should declare a ref, like in the earlier example, and pass it to <MyInput>.\nMyInput should be declared with forwardRef to take that ref and forward it down to the <input> node.\n\nThis version does that, so it no longer needs findDOMNode:\n\nApp.js\nAutoselectingInput.js\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createRef, Component } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nclass AutoselectingInput extends Component {\n  inputRef = createRef(null);\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    const input = this.inputRef.current;\n    input.select()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <MyInput ref={this.inputRef} />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AutoselectingInput;\n\n\nShow more\n\nHere is how this code would look like with function components instead of classes:\n\nApp.js\nAutoselectingInput.js\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function AutoselectingInput() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const input = inputRef.current;\n    input.select();\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MyInput ref={inputRef} defaultValue=\"Hello\" />\n}\n\n\nAdding a wrapper <div> element \n\nSometimes a component needs to know the position and size of its children. This makes it tempting to find the children with findDOMNode(this), and then use DOM methods like getBoundingClientRect for measurements.\n\nThere is currently no direct equivalent for this use case, which is why findDOMNode is deprecated but is not yet removed completely from React. In the meantime, you can try rendering a wrapper <div> node around the content as a workaround, and getting a ref to that node. However, extra wrappers can break styling.\n\n<div ref={someRef}>\n\n  {children}\n\n</div>\n\nThis also applies to focusing and scrolling to arbitrary children.\n\nPREVIOUS\nflushSync\nNEXT\nhydrate"

Use flushSync to force React to flush any state updates inside the callback synchronously:\n\nflushSync(() => {\n\n  setSomething(123);\n\n});\n\n// By this line, the DOM is updated.\n\nThis ensures that, by the time the next line of code runs, React has already updated the DOM.\n\nUsing flushSync is uncommon, and using it often can significantly hurt the performance of your app. If your app only uses React APIs, and does not integrate with third-party libraries, flushSync should be unnecessary.\n\nHowever, it can be helpful for integrating with third-party code like browser APIs.\n\nSome browser APIs expect results inside of callbacks to be written to the DOM synchronously, by the end of the callback, so the browser can do something with the rendered DOM. In most cases, React handles this for you automatically. But in some cases it may be necessary to force a synchronous update.\n\nFor example, the browser onbeforeprint API allows you to change the page immediately before the print dialog opens. This is useful for applying custom print styles that allow the document to display better for printing. In the example below, you use flushSync inside of the onbeforeprint callback to immediately “flush” the React state to the DOM. Then, by the time the print dialog opens, isPrinting displays “yes”:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { flushSync } from 'react-dom';\n\nexport default function PrintApp() {\n  const [isPrinting, setIsPrinting] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function handleBeforePrint() {\n      flushSync(() => {\n        setIsPrinting(true);\n      })\n    }\n\n    function handleAfterPrint() {\n      setIsPrinting(false);\n    }\n\n    window.addEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint);\n    window.addEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint);\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint);\n      window.removeEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>isPrinting: {isPrinting ? 'yes' : 'no'}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => window.print()}>\n        Print\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWithout flushSync, the print dialog will display isPrinting as “no”. This is because React batches the updates asynchronously and the print dialog is displayed before the state is updated.\n\nPitfall\n\nflushSync can significantly hurt performance, and may unexpectedly force pending Suspense boundaries to show their fallback state.\n\nMost of the time, flushSync can be avoided, so use flushSync as a last resort.\n\nPREVIOUS\ncreatePortal\nNEXT\nfindDOMNode"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nAPIS\ncreatePortal\n\ncreatePortal lets you render some children into a different part of the DOM.\n\n<div>\n\n  <SomeComponent />\n\n  {createPortal(children, domNode, key?)}\n\n</div>\nReference\ncreatePortal(children, domNode, key?)\nUsage\nRendering to a different part of the DOM\nRendering a modal dialog with a portal\nRendering React components into non-React server markup\nRendering React components into non-React DOM nodes\nReference \ncreatePortal(children, domNode, key?) \n\nTo create a portal, call createPortal, passing some JSX, and the DOM node where it should be rendered:\n\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\n\n\n\n// ...\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n  <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>\n\n  {createPortal(\n\n    <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,\n\n    document.body\n\n  )}\n\n</div>\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nA portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.\n\nParameters \n\nchildren: Anything that can be rendered with React, such as a piece of JSX (e.g. <div /> or <SomeComponent />), a Fragment (<>...</>), a string or a number, or an array of these.\n\ndomNode: Some DOM node, such as those returned by document.getElementById(). The node must already exist. Passing a different DOM node during an update will cause the portal content to be recreated.\n\noptional key: A unique string or number to be used as the portal’s key.\n\nReturns \n\ncreatePortal returns a React node that can be included into JSX or returned from a React component. If React encounters it in the render output, it will place the provided children inside the provided domNode.\n\nCaveats \nEvents from portals propagate according to the React tree rather than the DOM tree. For example, if you click inside a portal, and the portal is wrapped in <div onClick>, that onClick handler will fire. If this causes issues, either stop the event propagation from inside the portal, or move the portal itself up in the React tree.\nUsage \nRendering to a different part of the DOM \n\nPortals let your components render some of their children into a different place in the DOM. This lets a part of your component “escape” from whatever containers it may be in. For example, a component can display a modal dialog or a tooltip that appears above and outside of the rest of the page.\n\nTo create a portal, render the result of createPortal with some JSX and the DOM node where it should go:\n\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>\n\n      <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>\n\n      {createPortal(\n\n        <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,\n\n        document.body\n\n      )}\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will put the DOM nodes for the JSX you passed inside of the DOM node you provided.\n\nWithout a portal, the second <p> would be placed inside the parent <div>, but the portal “teleported” it into the document.body:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\n\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>\n      <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>\n      {createPortal(\n        <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,\n        document.body\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nNotice how the second paragraph visually appears outside the parent <div> with the border. If you inspect the DOM structure with developer tools, you’ll see that the second <p> got placed directly into the <body>:\n\n<body>\n\n  <div id=\"root\">\n\n    ...\n\n      <div style=\"border: 2px solid black\">\n\n        <p>This child is placed inside the parent div.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n    ...\n\n  </div>\n\n  <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>\n\n</body>\n\nA portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events still bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.\n\nRendering a modal dialog with a portal \n\nYou can use a portal to create a modal dialog that floats above the rest of the page, even if the component that summons the dialog is inside a container with overflow: hidden or other styles that interfere with the dialog.\n\nIn this example, the two containers have styles that disrupt the modal dialog, but the one rendered into a portal is unaffected because, in the DOM, the modal is not contained within the parent JSX elements.\n\nApp.js\nNoPortalExample.js\nPortalExample.js\nModalContent.js\nReset\nFork\nimport NoPortalExample from './NoPortalExample';\nimport PortalExample from './PortalExample';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"clipping-container\">\n        <NoPortalExample  />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"clipping-container\">\n        <PortalExample />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nPitfall\n\nIt’s important to make sure that your app is accessible when using portals. For instance, you may need to manage keyboard focus so that the user can move the focus in and out of the portal in a natural way.\n\nFollow the WAI-ARIA Modal Authoring Practices when creating modals. If you use a community package, ensure that it is accessible and follows these guidelines.\n\nRendering React components into non-React server markup \n\nPortals can be useful if your React root is only part of a static or server-rendered page that isn’t built with React. For example, if your page is built with a server framework like Rails, you can create areas of interactivity within static areas such as sidebars. Compared with having multiple separate React roots, portals let you treat the app as a single React tree with shared state even though its parts render to different parts of the DOM.\n\nindex.html\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\n\nconst sidebarContentEl = document.getElementById('sidebar-content');\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <MainContent />\n      {createPortal(\n        <SidebarContent />,\n        sidebarContentEl\n      )}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MainContent() {\n  return <p>This part is rendered by React</p>;\n}\n\nfunction SidebarContent() {\n  return <p>This part is also rendered by React!</p>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nRendering React components into non-React DOM nodes \n\nYou can also use a portal to manage the content of a DOM node that’s managed outside of React. For example, suppose you’re integrating with a non-React map widget and you want to render React content inside a popup. To do this, declare a popupContainer state variable to store the DOM node you’re going to render into:\n\nconst [popupContainer, setPopupContainer] = useState(null);\n\nWhen you create the third-party widget, store the DOM node returned by the widget so you can render into it:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  if (mapRef.current === null) {\n\n    const map = createMapWidget(containerRef.current);\n\n    mapRef.current = map;\n\n    const popupDiv = addPopupToMapWidget(map);\n\n    setPopupContainer(popupDiv);\n\n  }\n\n}, []);\n\nThis lets you use createPortal to render React content into popupContainer once it becomes available:\n\nreturn (\n\n  <div style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }} ref={containerRef}>\n\n    {popupContainer !== null && createPortal(\n\n      <p>Hello from React!</p>,\n\n      popupContainer\n\n    )}\n\n  </div>\n\n);\n\nHere is a complete example you can play with:\n\nApp.js\nmap-widget.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport { createMapWidget, addPopupToMapWidget } from './map-widget.js';\n\nexport default function Map() {\n  const containerRef = useRef(null);\n  const mapRef = useRef(null);\n  const [popupContainer, setPopupContainer] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (mapRef.current === null) {\n      const map = createMapWidget(containerRef.current);\n      mapRef.current = map;\n      const popupDiv = addPopupToMapWidget(map);\n      setPopupContainer(popupDiv);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }} ref={containerRef}>\n      {popupContainer !== null && createPortal(\n        <p>Hello from React!</p>,\n        popupContainer\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nAPIs\nNEXT\nflushSync"

Use defaultValue for initial content.\nIf a text area receives a string value prop, it will be treated as controlled.\nA text area can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.\nA text area cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.\nEvery controlled text area needs an onChange event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.\nUsage \nDisplaying a text area \n\nRender <textarea> to display a text area.

To disable resizing, you can specify resize: none in the CSS.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function NewPost() {\n  return (\n    <label>\n      Write your post:\n      <textarea name=\"postContent\" rows={4} cols={40} />\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n\n\nProviding a label for a text area \n\nTypically, you will place every <textarea> inside a <label> tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that text area. When the user clicks the label, the browser will focus the text area. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the text area.\n\nIf you can’t nest <textarea> into a <label>, associate them by passing the same ID to <textarea id> and <label htmlFor>.

The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { postContent: \"Your post\" }.\n\nPitfall\n\nBy default, any <button> inside a <form> will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=\"button\"> instead of <button>. Then, to be explicit, use <button type=\"submit\"> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.\n\nControlling a text area with a state variable \n\nA text area like <textarea /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initial value like <textarea defaultValue=\"Initial text\" />, your JSX only specifies the initial value, not the value right now.\n\nTo render a controlled text area, pass the value prop to it. React will force the text area to always have the value you passed. Typically, you will control a text area by declaring a state variable:\n\nfunction NewPost() {\n\n  const [postContent, setPostContent] = useState(''); // Declare a state variable...\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <textarea\n\n      value={postContent} // ...force the input's value to match the state variable...\n\n      onChange={e => setPostContent(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any edits!\n\n    />\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis is useful if you want to re-render some part of the UI in response to every keystroke.\n\nApp.js\nMarkdownPreview.js\npackage.json\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport MarkdownPreview from './MarkdownPreview.js';\n\nexport default function MarkdownEditor() {\n  const [postContent, setPostContent] = useState('_Hello,_ **Markdown**!');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Enter some markdown:\n        <textarea\n          value={postContent}\n          onChange={e => setPostContent(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <MarkdownPreview markdown={postContent} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nIf you pass value without onChange, it will be impossible to type into the text area. When you control an text area by passing some value to it, you force it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the text area after every keystroke back to the value that you specified.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy text area doesn’t update when I type into it \n\nIf you render a text area with value but no onChange, you will see an error in the console:\n\n// 🔴 Bug: controlled text area with no onChange handler\n\n<textarea value={something} />\nConsole\nYou provided a value prop to a form field without an onChange handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use defaultValue. Otherwise, set either onChange or readOnly.\n\nAs the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultValue instead:\n\n// ✅ Good: uncontrolled text area with an initial value\n\n<textarea defaultValue={something} />\n\nIf you want to control this text area with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:\n\n// ✅ Good: controlled text area with onChange\n\n<textarea value={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.value)} />\n\nIf the value is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:\n\n// ✅ Good: readonly controlled text area without on change\n\n<textarea value={something} readOnly={true} />\nMy text area caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke \n\nIf you control a text area, you must update its state variable to the text area’s value from the DOM during onChange.\n\nYou can’t update it to something other than e.target.value:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input to something other than e.target.value\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value.toUpperCase());\n\n}\n\nYou also can’t update it asynchronously:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input asynchronously\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n  }, 100);\n\n}\n\nTo fix your code, update it synchronously to e.target.value:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // ✅ Updating a controlled input to e.target.value synchronously\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n}\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the text area gets removed and re-added from the DOM on every keystroke. This can happen if you’re accidentally resetting state on every re-render. For example, this can happen if the text area or one of its parents always receives a different key attribute, or if you nest component definitions (which is not allowed in React and causes the “inner” component to remount on every render).\n\nI’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled” \n\nIf you provide a value to the component, it must remain a string throughout its lifetime.\n\nYou cannot pass value={undefined} first and later pass value=\"some string\" because React won’t know whether you want the component to be uncontrolled or controlled. A controlled component should always receive a string value, not null or undefined.\n\nIf your value is coming from an API or a state variable, it might be initialized to null or undefined. In that case, either set it to an empty string ('') initially, or pass value={someValue ?? ''} to ensure value is a string.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<select>\nNEXT\nAPIs"

Controls which option is selected. Every value string match the value of some <option> nested inside the <select>.\n\nWhen you pass value, you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value.\n\nIf your <select> is uncontrolled, you may pass the defaultValue prop instead:\n\ndefaultValue: A string (or an array of strings for multiple={true}). Specifies the initially selected option.\n\nThese <select> props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled select boxes:\n\nautoComplete: A string. Specifies one of the possible autocomplete behaviors.\nautoFocus: A boolean. If true, React will focus the element on mount.\nchildren: <select> accepts <option>, <optgroup>, and <datalist> components as children. You can also pass your own components as long as they eventually render one of the allowed components. If you pass your own components that eventually render <option> tags, each <option> you render must have a value.\ndisabled: A boolean. If true, the select box will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.\nform: A string. Specifies the id of the <form> this select box belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.\nmultiple: A boolean. If true, the browser allows multiple selection.\nname: A string. Specifies the name for this select box that’s submitted with the form.\nonChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled select boxes. Fires immediately when the user picks a different option. Behaves like the browser input event.\nonChangeCapture: A version of onChange that fires in the capture phase.\nonInput: An Event handler function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use onChange instead which works similarly.\nonInputCapture: A version of onInput that fires in the capture phase.\nonInvalid: An Event handler function. Fires if an input fails validation on form submit. Unlike the built-in invalid event, the React onInvalid event bubbles.\nonInvalidCapture: A version of onInvalid that fires in the capture phase.\nrequired: A boolean. If true, the value must be provided for the form to submit.\nsize: A number. For multiple={true} selects, specifies the preferred number of initially visible items.\nCaveats \nUnlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to <option> is not supported. Instead, use <select defaultValue> for uncontrolled select boxes and <select value> for controlled select boxes.\nIf a select box receives a value prop, it will be treated as controlled.\nA select box can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.\nA select box cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.\nEvery controlled select box needs an onChange event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.\nUsage \nDisplaying a select box with options \n\nRender a <select> with a list of <option> components inside to display a select box. Give each <option> a value representing the data to be submitted with the form.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function FruitPicker() {\n  return (\n    <label>\n      Pick a fruit:\n      <select name=\"selectedFruit\">\n        <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n        <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n        <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n      </select>\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n\n\nProviding a label for a select box \n\nTypically, you will place every <select> inside a <label> tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that select box. When the user clicks the label, the browser will automatically focus the select box. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the select box.\n\nIf you can’t nest <select> into a <label>, associate them by passing the same ID to <select id> and <label htmlFor>. To avoid conflicts between multiple instances of one component, generate such an ID with useId.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useId } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const vegetableSelectId = useId();\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Pick a fruit:\n        <select name=\"selectedFruit\">\n          <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n          <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n          <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <label htmlFor={vegetableSelectId}>\n        Pick a vegetable:\n      </label>\n      <select id={vegetableSelectId} name=\"selectedVegetable\">\n        <option value=\"cucumber\">Cucumber</option>\n        <option value=\"corn\">Corn</option>\n        <option value=\"tomato\">Tomato</option>\n      </select>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nProviding an initially selected option \n\nBy default, the browser will select the first <option> in the list.

In that case, if you also specify defaultValue to choose the initially selected options, it must be an array.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function FruitPicker() {\n  return (\n    <label>\n      Pick some fruits:\n      <select\n        name=\"selectedFruit\"\n        defaultValue={['orange', 'banana']}\n        multiple={true}\n      >\n        <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n        <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n        <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n      </select>\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nReading the select box value when submitting a form \n\nAdd a <form> around your select box with a <button type=\"submit\"> inside. It will call your <form onSubmit> event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling e.preventDefault(). Read the form data with new FormData(e.target).\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function EditPost() {\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n    // Prevent the browser from reloading the page\n    e.preventDefault();\n    // Read the form data\n    const form = e.target;\n    const formData = new FormData(form);\n    // You can pass formData as a fetch body directly:\n    fetch('/some-api', { method: form.method, body: formData });\n    // You can generate a URL out of it, as the browser does by default:\n    console.log(new URLSearchParams(formData).toString());\n    // You can work with it as a plain object.\n    const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());\n    console.log(formJson); // (!) This doesn't include multiple select values\n    // Or you can get an array of name-value pairs.\n    console.log([...formData.entries()]);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form method=\"post\" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <label>\n        Pick your favorite fruit:\n        <select name=\"selectedFruit\" defaultValue=\"orange\">\n          <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n          <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n          <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Pick all your favorite vegetables:\n        <select\n          name=\"selectedVegetables\"\n          multiple={true}\n          defaultValue={['corn', 'tomato']}\n        >\n          <option value=\"cucumber\">Cucumber</option>\n          <option value=\"corn\">Corn</option>\n          <option value=\"tomato\">Tomato</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <button type=\"reset\">Reset</button>\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nGive a name to your <select>, for example <select name=\"selectedFruit\" />. The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { selectedFruit: \"orange\" }.\n\nIf you use <select multiple={true}>, the FormData you’ll read from the form will include each selected value as a separate name-value pair. Look closely at the console logs in the example above.\n\nPitfall\n\nBy default, any <button> inside a <form> will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=\"button\"> instead of <button>. Then, to be explicit, use <button type=\"submit\"> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.\n\nControlling a select box with a state variable \n\nA select box like <select /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initially selected value like <select defaultValue=\"orange\" />, your JSX only specifies the initial value, not the value right now.\n\nTo render a controlled select box, pass the value prop to it. React will force the select box to always have the value you passed. Typically, you will control a select box by declaring a state variable:\n\nfunction FruitPicker() {\n\n  const [selectedFruit, setSelectedFruit] = useState('orange'); // Declare a state variable...\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <select\n\n      value={selectedFruit} // ...force the select's value to match the state variable...\n\n      onChange={e => setSelectedFruit(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any change!\n\n    >\n\n      <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n\n      <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n\n      <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n\n    </select>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis is useful if you want to re-render some part of the UI in response to every selection.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function FruitPicker() {\n  const [selectedFruit, setSelectedFruit] = useState('orange');\n  const [selectedVegs, setSelectedVegs] = useState(['corn', 'tomato']);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Pick a fruit:\n        <select\n          value={selectedFruit}\n          onChange={e => setSelectedFruit(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n          <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n          <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <label>\n        Pick all your favorite vegetables:\n        <select\n          multiple={true}\n          value={selectedVegs}\n          onChange={e => {\n            const options = [...e.target.selectedOptions];\n            const values = options.map(option => option.value);\n            setSelectedVegs(values);\n          }}\n        >\n          <option value=\"cucumber\">Cucumber</option>\n          <option value=\"corn\">Corn</option>\n          <option value=\"tomato\">Tomato</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <p>Your favorite fruit: {selectedFruit}</p>\n      <p>Your favorite vegetables: {selectedVegs.join(', ')}</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nIf you pass value without onChange, it will be impossible to select an option. When you control a select box by passing some value to it, you force it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the select box after every keystroke back to the value that you specified.\n\nUnlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to an individual <option> is not supported.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<progress>\nNEXT\n<textarea>"

Read the form data with new FormData(e.target).\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function MyForm() {\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n    // Prevent the browser from reloading the page\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // Read the form data\n    const form = e.target;\n    const formData = new FormData(form);\n\n    // You can pass formData as a fetch body directly:\n    fetch('/some-api', { method: form.method, body: formData });\n\n    // Or you can work with it as a plain object:\n    const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());\n    console.log(formJson);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form method=\"post\" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <label>\n        Text input: <input name=\"myInput\" defaultValue=\"Some initial value\" />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <label>\n        Checkbox: <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"myCheckbox\" defaultChecked={true} />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <p>\n        Radio buttons:\n        <label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option1\" /> Option 1</label>\n        <label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option2\" defaultChecked={true} /> Option 2</label>\n        <label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option3\" /> Option 3</label>\n      </p>\n      <hr />\n      <button type=\"reset\">Reset form</button>\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit form</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nGive a name to every <input>, for example <input name=\"firstName\" defaultValue=\"Taylor\" />. The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { firstName: \"Taylor\" }.\n\nPitfall\n\nBy default, any <button> inside a <form> will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=\"button\"> instead of <button>. Then, to be explicit, use <button type=\"submit\"> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.\n\nControlling an input with a state variable \n\nAn input like <input /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initial value like <input defaultValue=\"Initial text\" />, your JSX only specifies the initial value. It does not control what the value should be right now.\n\nTo render a controlled input, pass the value prop to it (or checked for checkboxes and radios). React will force the input to always have the value you passed. Usually, you would do this by declaring a state variable:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); // Declare a state variable...\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <input\n\n      value={firstName} // ...force the input's value to match the state variable...\n\n      onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any edits!\n\n    />\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nA controlled input makes sense if you needed state anyway—for example, to re-render your UI on every edit:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        First name:\n\n        <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      {firstName !== '' && <p>Your name is {firstName}.</p>}\n\n      ...\n\nIt’s also useful if you want to offer multiple ways to adjust the input state (for example, by clicking a button):\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState('');\n\n  const ageAsNumber = Number(age);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Age:\n\n        <input\n\n          value={age}\n\n          onChange={e => setAge(e.target.value)}\n\n          type=\"number\"\n\n        />\n\n        <button onClick={() => setAge(ageAsNumber + 10)}>\n\n          Add 10 years\n\n        </button>\n\nThe value you pass to controlled components should not be undefined or null. If you need the initial value to be empty (such as with the firstName field below), initialize your state variable to an empty string ('').\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [age, setAge] = useState('20');\n  const ageAsNumber = Number(age);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input\n          value={firstName}\n          onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Age:\n        <input\n          value={age}\n          onChange={e => setAge(e.target.value)}\n          type=\"number\"\n        />\n        <button onClick={() => setAge(ageAsNumber + 10)}>\n          Add 10 years\n        </button>\n      </label>\n      {firstName !== '' &&\n        <p>Your name is {firstName}.</p>\n      }\n      {ageAsNumber > 0 &&\n        <p>Your age is {ageAsNumber}.</p>\n      }\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nIf you pass value without onChange, it will be impossible to type into the input. When you control an input by passing some value to it, you force it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the input after every keystroke back to the value that you specified.\n\nOptimizing re-rendering on every keystroke \n\nWhen you use a controlled input, you set the state on every keystroke. If the component containing your state re-renders a large tree, this can get slow. There’s a few ways you can optimize re-rendering performance.\n\nFor example, suppose you start with a form that re-renders all page content on every keystroke:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <form>\n\n        <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </form>\n\n      <PageContent />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nSince <PageContent /> doesn’t rely on the input state, you can move the input state into its own component:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <SignupForm />\n\n      <PageContent />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction SignupForm() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis significantly improves performance because now only SignupForm re-renders on every keystroke.\n\nIf there is no way to avoid re-rendering (for example, if PageContent depends on the search input’s value), useDeferredValue lets you keep the controlled input responsive even in the middle of a large re-render.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy text input doesn’t update when I type into it \n\nIf you render an input with value but no onChange, you will see an error in the console:\n\n// 🔴 Bug: controlled text input with no onChange handler\n\n<input value={something} />\nConsole\nYou provided a value prop to a form field without an onChange handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use defaultValue. Otherwise, set either onChange or readOnly.\n\nAs the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultValue instead:\n\n// ✅ Good: uncontrolled input with an initial value\n\n<input defaultValue={something} />\n\nIf you want to control this input with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:\n\n// ✅ Good: controlled input with onChange\n\n<input value={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.value)} />\n\nIf the value is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:\n\n// ✅ Good: readonly controlled input without on change\n\n<input value={something} readOnly={true} />\nMy checkbox doesn’t update when I click on it \n\nIf you render a checkbox with checked but no onChange, you will see an error in the console:\n\n// 🔴 Bug: controlled checkbox with no onChange handler\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked={something} />\nConsole\nYou provided a checked prop to a form field without an onChange handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use defaultChecked. Otherwise, set either onChange or readOnly.\n\nAs the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultChecked instead:\n\n// ✅ Good: uncontrolled checkbox with an initial value\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" defaultChecked={something} />\n\nIf you want to control this checkbox with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:\n\n// ✅ Good: controlled checkbox with onChange\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.checked)} />\nPitfall\n\nYou need to read e.target.checked rather than e.target.value for checkboxes.\n\nIf the checkbox is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:\n\n// ✅ Good: readonly controlled input without on change\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked={something} readOnly={true} />\nMy input caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke \n\nIf you control an input, you must update its state variable to the input’s value from the DOM during onChange.\n\nYou can’t update it to something other than e.target.value (or e.target.checked for checkboxes):\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input to something other than e.target.value\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value.toUpperCase());\n\n}\n\nYou also can’t update it asynchronously:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input asynchronously\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n  }, 100);\n\n}\n\nTo fix your code, update it synchronously to e.target.value:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // ✅ Updating a controlled input to e.target.value synchronously\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n}\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the input gets removed and re-added from the DOM on every keystroke. This can happen if you’re accidentally resetting state on every re-render, for example if the input or one of its parents always receives a different key attribute, or if you nest component function definitions (which is not supported and causes the “inner” component to always be considered a different tree).\n\nI’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled” \n\nIf you provide a value to the component, it must remain a string throughout its lifetime.\n\nYou cannot pass value={undefined} first and later pass value=\"some string\" because React won’t know whether you want the component to be uncontrolled or controlled. A controlled component should always receive a string value, not null or undefined.\n\nIf your value is coming from an API or a state variable, it might be initialized to null or undefined. In that case, either set it to an empty string ('') initially, or pass value={someValue ?? ''} to ensure value is a string.\n\nSimilarly, if you pass checked to a checkbox, ensure it’s always a boolean.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<form>\nNEXT\n<option>"

When a URL is passed to action the form will behave like the HTML form component. When a function is passed to action the function will handle the form submission. The function passed to action may be async and will be called with a single argument containing the form data of the submitted form. The action prop can be overridden by a formAction attribute on a <button>, <input type=\"submit\">, or <input type=\"image\"> component.\n\nCaveats \nWhen a function is passed to action or formAction the HTTP method will be POST regardless of value of the method prop.\nUsage \nHandle form submission on the client \n\nPass a function to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted. formData will be passed to the function as an argument so you can access the data submitted by the form. This differs from the conventional HTML action, which only accepts URLs.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Search() {\n  function search(formData) {\n    const query = formData.get(\"query\");\n    alert(`You searched for '${query}'`);\n  }\n  return (\n    <form action={search}>\n      <input name=\"query\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nHandle form submission with a Server Action \n\nRender a <form> with an input and submit button. Pass a Server Action (a function marked with 'use server') to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted.\n\nPassing a Server Action to <form action> allow users to submit forms without JavaScript enabled or before the code has loaded. This is beneficial to users who have a slow connection, device, or have JavaScript disabled and is similar to the way forms work when a URL is passed to the action prop.\n\nYou can use hidden form fields to provide data to the <form>’s action. The Server Action will be called with the hidden form field data as an instance of FormData.\n\nimport { updateCart } from './lib.js';\n\n\n\nfunction AddToCart({productId}) {\n\n  async function addToCart(formData) {\n\n    'use server'\n\n    const productId = formData.get('productId')\n\n    await updateCart(productId)\n\n  }\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={addToCart}>\n\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"productId\" value={productId} />\n\n        <button type=\"submit\">Add to Cart</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn lieu of using hidden form fields to provide data to the <form>’s action, you can call the bind method to supply it with extra arguments. This will bind a new argument (productId) to the function in addition to the formData that is passed as a argument to the function.\n\nimport { updateCart } from './lib.js';\n\n\n\nfunction AddToCart({productId}) {\n\n  async function addToCart(productId, formData) {\n\n    \"use server\";\n\n    await updateCart(productId)\n\n  }\n\n  const addProductToCart = addToCart.bind(null, productId);\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={addProductToCart}>\n\n      <button type=\"submit\">Add to Cart</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWhen <form> is rendered by a Server Component, and a Server Action is passed to the <form>’s action prop, the form is progressively enhanced.\n\nDisplay a pending state during form submission \n\nTo display a pending state when a form is being submitted, you can call the useFormStatus Hook in a component rendered in a <form> and read the pending property returned.\n\nHere, we use the pending property to indicate the form is submitting.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useFormStatus } from \"react-dom\";\nimport { submitForm } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction Submit() {\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus();\n  return (\n    <button type=\"submit\" disabled={pending}>\n      {pending ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form({ action }) {\n  return (\n    <form action={action}>\n      <Submit />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <Form action={submitForm} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo learn more about the useFormStatus Hook see the reference documentation.\n\nOptimistically updating form data \n\nThe useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.\n\nFor example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.\n\nApp.js\nactions.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useOptimistic, useState, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { deliverMessage } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction Thread({ messages, sendMessage }) {\n  const formRef = useRef();\n  async function formAction(formData) {\n    addOptimisticMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    formRef.current.reset();\n    await sendMessage(formData);\n  }\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(\n    messages,\n    (state, newMessage) => [\n      ...state,\n      {\n        text: newMessage,\n        sending: true\n      }\n    ]\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((message, index) => (\n        <div key={index}>\n          {message.text}\n          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      <form action={formAction} ref={formRef}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Hello!\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([\n    { text: \"Hello there!\", sending: false, key: 1 }\n  ]);\n  async function sendMessage(formData) {\n    const sentMessage = await deliverMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    setMessages([...messages, { text: sentMessage }]);\n  }\n  return <Thread messages={messages} sendMessage={sendMessage} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nHandling form submission errors \n\nIn some cases the function called by a <form>’s action prop throw an error. You can handle these errors by wrapping <form> in an Error Boundary.

The action returned by useFormState should be passed to the action prop of the form. The state variable returned by useFormState can be used to displayed an error message. The value returned by the Server Action passed to useFormState will be used to update the state variable.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useFormState } from \"react-dom\";\nimport { signUpNewUser } from \"./api\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  async function signup(prevState, formData) {\n    \"use server\";\n    const email = formData.get(\"email\");\n    try {\n      await signUpNewUser(email);\n      alert(`Added \"${email}\"`);\n    } catch (err) {\n      return err.toString();\n    }\n  }\n  const [message, formAction] = useFormState(signup, null);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Signup for my newsletter</h1>\n      <p>Signup with the same email twice to see an error</p>\n      <form action={formAction} id=\"signup-form\">\n        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email: </label>\n        <input name=\"email\" id=\"email\" placeholder=\"react@example.com\" />\n        <button>Sign up</button>\n        {!!message && <p>{message}</p>}\n      </form>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nLearn more about updating state from a form action with the useFormState docs\n\nHandling multiple submission types \n\nForms can be designed to handle multiple submission actions based on the button pressed by the user. Each button inside a form can be associated with a distinct action or behavior by setting the formAction prop.\n\nWhen a user taps a specific button, the form is submitted, and a corresponding action, defined by that button’s attributes and action, is executed. For instance, a form might submit an article for review by default but have a separate button with formAction set to save the article as a draft.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Search() {\n  function publish(formData) {\n    const content = formData.get(\"content\");\n    const button = formData.get(\"button\");\n    alert(`'${content}' was published with the '${button}' button`);\n  }\n\n  function save(formData) {\n    const content = formData.get(\"content\");\n    alert(`Your draft of '${content}' has been saved!`);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form action={publish}>\n      <textarea name=\"content\" rows={4} cols={40} />\n      <br />\n      <button type=\"submit\" name=\"button\" value=\"submit\">Publish</button>\n      <button formAction={save}>Save draft</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nCommon (e.g. <div>)\nNEXT\n<input>"

Specifies the content inside the component. When you use JSX, you will usually specify the children prop implicitly by nesting tags like <div><span /></div>.\n\ndangerouslySetInnerHTML: An object of the form { __html: '<p>some html</p>' } with a raw HTML string inside. Overrides the innerHTML property of the DOM node and displays the passed HTML inside. This should be used with extreme caution! If the HTML inside isn’t trusted (for example, if it’s based on user data), you risk introducing an XSS vulnerability. Read more about using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.\n\nref: A ref object from useRef or createRef, or a ref callback function, or a string for legacy refs. Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.\n\nsuppressContentEditableWarning: A boolean. If true, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have children and contentEditable={true} (which normally do not work together). Use this if you’re building a text input library that manages the contentEditable content manually.\n\nsuppressHydrationWarning: A boolean. If you use server rendering, normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. In some rare cases (like timestamps), it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. If you set suppressHydrationWarning to true, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Read about suppressing hydration errors.\n\nstyle: An object with CSS styles, for example { fontWeight: 'bold', margin: 20 }. Similarly to the DOM style property, the CSS property names need to be written as camelCase, for example fontWeight instead of font-weight. You can pass strings or numbers as values. If you pass a number, like width: 100, React will automatically append px (“pixels”) to the value unless it’s a unitless property. We recommend using style only for dynamic styles where you don’t know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with className is more efficient. Read more about className and style.\n\nThese standard DOM props are also supported for all built-in components:\n\naccessKey: A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. Not generally recommended.\naria-*: ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See ARIA attributes for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML.\nautoCapitalize: A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized.\nclassName: A string. Specifies the element’s CSS class name. Read more about applying CSS styles.\ncontentEditable: A boolean. If true, the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly. This is used to implement rich text input libraries like Lexical. React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with contentEditable={true} because React will not be able to update its content after user edits.\ndata-*: Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example data-fruit=\"banana\". In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead.\ndir: Either 'ltr' or 'rtl'. Specifies the text direction of the element.\ndraggable: A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of HTML Drag and Drop API.\nenterKeyHint: A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.\nhtmlFor: A string. For <label> and <output>, lets you associate the label with some control. Same as for HTML attribute. React uses the standard DOM property names (htmlFor) instead of HTML attribute names.\nhidden: A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden.\nid: A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with useId to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component.\nis: A string. If specified, the component will behave like a custom element.\ninputMode: A string. Specifies what kind of keyboard to display (for example, text, number or telephone).\nitemProp: A string.

When that <div> DOM node is removed, React will call your ref callback with null.\n\nReact will also call your ref callback whenever you pass a different ref callback. In the above example, (node) => { ... } is a different function on every render. When your component re-renders, the previous function will be called with null as the argument, and the next function will be called with the DOM node.\n\nParameters \nnode: A DOM node or null. React will pass you the DOM node when the ref gets attached, and null when the ref gets detached. Unless you pass the same function reference for the ref callback on every render, the callback will get temporarily detached and re-attached during every re-render of the component.\nReturns \n\nDo not return anything from the ref callback.\n\nReact event object \n\nYour event handlers will receive a React event object. It is also sometimes known as a “synthetic event”.\n\n<button onClick={e => {\n\n  console.log(e); // React event object\n\n}} />\n\nIt conforms to the same standard as the underlying DOM events, but fixes some browser inconsistencies.\n\nSome React events do not map directly to the browser’s native events. For example in onMouseLeave, e.nativeEvent will point to a mouseout event. The specific mapping is not part of the public API and may change in the future. If you need the underlying browser event for some reason, read it from e.nativeEvent.\n\nProperties \n\nReact event objects implement some of the standard Event properties:\n\nbubbles: A boolean. Returns whether the event bubbles through the DOM.\ncancelable: A boolean. Returns whether the event can be canceled.\ncurrentTarget: A DOM node. Returns the node to which the current handler is attached in the React tree.\ndefaultPrevented: A boolean. Returns whether preventDefault was called.\neventPhase: A number. Returns which phase the event is currently in.\nisTrusted: A boolean. Returns whether the event was initiated by user.\ntarget: A DOM node. Returns the node on which the event has occurred (which could be a distant child).\ntimeStamp: A number. Returns the time when the event occurred.\n\nAdditionally, React event objects provide these properties:\n\nnativeEvent: A DOM Event. The original browser event object.\nMethods \n\nReact event objects implement some of the standard Event methods:\n\npreventDefault(): Prevents the default browser action for the event.\nstopPropagation(): Stops the event propagation through the React tree.\n\nAdditionally, React event objects provide these methods:\n\nisDefaultPrevented(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether preventDefault was called.\nisPropagationStopped(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether stopPropagation was called.\npersist(): Not used with React DOM. With React Native, call this to read event’s properties after the event.\nisPersistent(): Not used with React DOM. With React Native, returns whether persist has been called.\nCaveats \nThe values of currentTarget, eventPhase, target, and type reflect the values your React code expects. Under the hood, React attaches event handlers at the root, but this is not reflected in React event objects. For example, e.currentTarget may not be the same as the underlying e.nativeEvent.currentTarget. For polyfilled events, e.type (React event type) may differ from e.nativeEvent.type (underlying type).\nAnimationEvent handler function \n\nAn event handler type for the CSS animation events.\n\n<div\n\n  onAnimationStart={e => console.log('onAnimationStart')}\n\n  onAnimationIteration={e => console.log('onAnimationIteration')}\n\n  onAnimationEnd={e => console.log('onAnimationEnd')}\n\n/>\nParameters \ne: A React event object with these extra AnimationEvent properties:\nanimationName\nelapsedTime\npseudoElement\nClipboardEvent handler function \n\nAn event handler type for the Clipboard API events.\n\n<input\n\n  onCopy={e => console.log('onCopy')}\n\n  onCut={e => console.log('onCut')}\n\n  onPaste={e => console.log('onPaste')}\n\n/>\nParameters \n\ne: A React event object with these extra ClipboardEvent properties:\n\nclipboardData\nCompositionEvent handler function \n\nAn event handler type for the input method editor (IME) events.\n\n<input\n\n  onCompositionStart={e => console.log('onCompositionStart')}\n\n  onCompositionUpdate={e => console.log('onCompositionUpdate')}\n\n  onCompositionEnd={e => console.log('onCompositionEnd')}\n\n/>\nParameters \ne: A React event object with these extra CompositionEvent properties:\ndata\nDragEvent handler function \n\nAn event handler type for the HTML Drag and Drop API events.\n\n<>\n\n  <div\n\n    draggable={true}\n\n    onDragStart={e => console.log('onDragStart')}\n\n    onDragEnd={e => console.log('onDragEnd')}\n\n  >\n\n    Drag source\n\n  </div>\n\n\n\n  <div\n\n    onDragEnter={e => console.log('onDragEnter')}\n\n    onDragLeave={e => console.log('onDragLeave')}\n\n    onDragOver={e => { e.preventDefault();

It works like the class attribute in HTML:\n\n<img className=\"avatar\" />\n\nThen you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:\n\n/* In your CSS */\n\n.avatar {\n\n  border-radius: 50%;\n\n}\n\nReact does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a <link> tag to your HTML. If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project.\n\nSometimes, the style values depend on data. Use the style attribute to pass some styles dynamically:\n\n<img\n\n  className=\"avatar\"\n\n  style={{\n\n    width: user.imageSize,\n\n    height: user.imageSize\n\n  }}\n\n/>\n\nIn the above example, style={{}} is not a special syntax, but a regular {} object inside the style={ } JSX curly braces. We recommend only using the style attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.\n\nAvatar.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Avatar({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <img\n      src={user.imageUrl}\n      alt={'Photo of ' + user.name}\n      className=\"avatar\"\n      style={{\n        width: user.imageSize,\n        height: user.imageSize\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to apply multiple CSS classes conditionally? \nShow Details\nManipulating a DOM node with a ref \n\nSometimes, you’ll need to get the browser DOM node associated with a tag in JSX. For example, if you want to focus an <input> when a button is clicked, you need to call focus() on the browser <input> DOM node.\n\nTo obtain the browser DOM node for a tag, declare a ref and pass it as the ref attribute to that tag:\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function Form() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <input ref={inputRef} />\n\n    // ...\n\nReact will put the DOM node into inputRef.current after it’s been rendered to the screen.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input ref={inputRef} />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Focus the input\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nRead more about manipulating DOM with refs and check out more examples.\n\nFor more advanced use cases, the ref attribute also accepts a callback function.\n\nDangerously setting the inner HTML \n\nYou can pass a raw HTML string to an element like so:\n\nconst markup = { __html: '<p>some raw html</p>' };\n\nreturn <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;\n\nThis is dangerous. As with the underlying DOM innerHTML property, you must exercise extreme caution! Unless the markup is coming from a completely trusted source, it is trivial to introduce an XSS vulnerability this way.\n\nFor example, if you use a Markdown library that converts Markdown to HTML, you trust that its parser doesn’t contain bugs, and the user only sees their own input, you can display the resulting HTML like this:\n\nMarkdownPreview.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Remarkable } from 'remarkable';\n\nconst md = new Remarkable();\n\nfunction renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown) {\n  // This is ONLY safe because the output HTML\n  // is shown to the same user, and because you\n  // trust this Markdown parser to not have bugs.\n  const renderedHTML = md.render(markdown);\n  return {__html: renderedHTML};\n}\n\nexport default function MarkdownPreview({ markdown }) {\n  const markup = renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown);\n  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo see why rendering arbitrary HTML is dangerous, replace the code above with this:\n\nconst post = {\n\n  // Imagine this content is stored in the database.\n\n  content: `<img src=\"\" onerror='alert(\"you were hacked\")'>`\n\n};\n\n\n\nexport default function MarkdownPreview() {\n\n  // 🔴 SECURITY HOLE: passing untrusted input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML\n\n  const markup = { __html: post.content };\n\n  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;\n\n}\n\nThe code embedded in the HTML will run. A hacker could use this security hole to steal user information or to perform actions on their behalf. Only use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with trusted and sanitized data.\n\nHandling mouse events \n\nThis example shows some common mouse events and when they fire.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function MouseExample() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      onMouseEnter={e => console.log('onMouseEnter (parent)')}\n      onMouseLeave={e => console.log('onMouseLeave (parent)')}\n    >\n      <button\n        onClick={e => console.log('onClick (first button)')}\n        onMouseDown={e => console.log('onMouseDown (first button)')}\n        onMouseEnter={e => console.log('onMouseEnter (first button)')}\n        onMouseLeave={e => console.log('onMouseLeave (first button)')}\n        onMouseOver={e => console.log('onMouseOver (first button)')}\n        onMouseUp={e => console.log('onMouseUp (first button)')}\n      >\n        First button\n      </button>\n      <button\n        onClick={e => console.log('onClick (second button)')}\n        onMouseDown={e => console.log('onMouseDown (second button)')}\n        onMouseEnter={e => console.log('onMouseEnter (second button)')}\n        onMouseLeave={e => console.log('onMouseLeave (second button)')}\n        onMouseOver={e => console.log('onMouseOver (second button)')}\n        onMouseUp={e => console.log('onMouseUp (second button)')}\n      >\n        Second button\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nHandling pointer events \n\nThis example shows some common pointer events and when they fire.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function PointerExample() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      onPointerEnter={e => console.log('onPointerEnter (parent)')}\n      onPointerLeave={e => console.log('onPointerLeave (parent)')}\n      style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: '#ddd' }}\n    >\n      <div\n        onPointerDown={e => console.log('onPointerDown (first child)')}\n        onPointerEnter={e => console.log('onPointerEnter (first child)')}\n        onPointerLeave={e => console.log('onPointerLeave (first child)')}\n        onPointerMove={e => console.log('onPointerMove (first child)')}\n        onPointerUp={e => console.log('onPointerUp (first child)')}\n        style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: 'lightyellow' }}\n      >\n        First child\n      </div>\n      <div\n        onPointerDown={e => console.log('onPointerDown (second child)')}\n        onPointerEnter={e => console.log('onPointerEnter (second child)')}\n        onPointerLeave={e => console.log('onPointerLeave (second child)')}\n        onPointerMove={e => console.log('onPointerMove (second child)')}\n        onPointerUp={e => console.log('onPointerUp (second child)')}\n        style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: 'lightblue' }}\n      >\n        Second child\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nHandling focus events \n\nIn React, focus events bubble. You can use the currentTarget and relatedTarget to differentiate if the focusing or blurring events originated from outside of the parent element.

In addition, you need to use a framework that supports React Server Components to get the full benefit of useFormState.\n\nuseFormState is a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.\n\nconst [state, formAction] = useFormState(fn, initialState);\nReference\nuseFormState(action, initialState)\nUsage\nUsing information returned by a form action\nTroubleshooting\nMy action can no longer read the submitted form data\nReference \nuseFormState(action, initialState) \n\nCall useFormState at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated when a form action is invoked. You pass useFormState an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided.\n\nimport { useFormState } from \"react-dom\";\n\n\n\nasync function increment(previousState, formData) {\n\n  return previousState + 1;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction StatefulForm({}) {\n\n  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(increment, 0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      {state}\n\n      <button formAction={formAction}>Increment</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nThe form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass.\n\nIf used with a Server Action, useFormState allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nfn: The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the initialState that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives.\ninitialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked.\nReturns \n\nuseFormState returns an array with exactly two values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action.\nA new action that you can pass as the action prop to your form component or formAction prop to any button component within the form.\nCaveats \nWhen used with a framework that supports React Server Components, useFormState lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state.\nThe function passed to useFormState receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using useFormState.\nUsage \nUsing information returned by a form action \n\nCall useFormState at the top level of your component to access the return value of an action from the last time a form was submitted.\n\nimport { useFormState } from 'react-dom';\n\nimport { action } from './actions.js';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(action, null);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={formAction}>\n\n      {/* ... */}\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nuseFormState returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe current state of the form, which is initially set to the initial state you provided, and after the form is submitted is set to the return value of the action you provided.\nA new action that you pass to <form> as its action prop.\n\nWhen the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form.\n\nThe action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called. The rest of the arguments are the same as if useFormState had not been used\n\nfunction action(currentState, formData) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return 'next state';\n\n}\nDisplay information after submitting a form\n1.

They must be written with single or double quotes, not backticks.\n'use server' can only be used in server-side files. The resulting Server Actions can be passed to Client Components through props. See supported types for serialization.\nTo import a Server Action from client code, the directive must be used on a module level.\nBecause the underlying network calls are always asynchronous, 'use server' can only be used on async functions.\nAlways treat arguments to Server Actions as untrusted input and authorize any mutations. See security considerations.\nServer Actions should be called in a transition. Server Actions passed to <form action> or formAction will automatically be called in a transition.\nServer Actions are designed for mutations that update server-side state; they are not recommended for data fetching. Accordingly, frameworks implementing Server Actions typically process one action at a time and do not have a way to cache the return value.\nSecurity considerations \n\nArguments to Server Actions are fully client-controlled. For security, always treat them as untrusted input, and make sure to validate and escape arguments as appropriate.\n\nIn any Server Action, make sure to validate that the logged-in user is allowed to perform that action.\n\nUnder Construction\n\nTo prevent sending sensitive data from a Server Action, there are experimental taint APIs to prevent unique values and objects from being passed to client code.\n\nSee experimental_taintUniqueValue and experimental_taintObjectReference.\n\nSerializable arguments and return values \n\nAs client code calls the Server Action over the network, any arguments passed will need to be serializable.\n\nHere are supported types for Server Action arguments:\n\nPrimitives\nstring\nnumber\nbigint\nboolean\nundefined\nnull\nsymbol, only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via Symbol.for\nIterables containing serializable values\nString\nArray\nMap\nSet\nTypedArray and ArrayBuffer\nDate\nFormData instances\nPlain objects: those created with object initializers, with serializable properties\nFunctions that are Server Actions\nPromises\n\nNotably, these are not supported:\n\nReact elements, or JSX\nFunctions, including component functions or any other function that is not a Server Action\nClasses\nObjects that are instances of any class (other than the built-ins mentioned) or objects with a null prototype\nSymbols not registered globally, ex. Symbol('my new symbol')\n\nSupported serializable return values are the same as serializable props for a boundary Client Component.\n\nUsage \nServer Actions in forms \n\nThe most common use case of Server Actions will be calling server functions that mutate data. On the browser, the HTML form element is the traditional approach for a user to submit a mutation. With React Server Components, React introduces first-class support for Server Actions in forms.\n\nHere is a form that allows a user to request a username.\n\n// App.js\n\n\n\nasync function requestUsername(formData) {\n\n  'use server';\n\n  const username = formData.get('username');\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={requestUsername}>\n\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" />\n\n      <button type=\"submit\">Request</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example requestUsername is a Server Action passed to a <form>. When a user submits this form, there is a network request to the server function requestUsername. When calling a Server Action in a form, React will supply the form’s FormData as the first argument to the Server Action.\n\nBy passing a Server Action to the form action, React can progressively enhance the form. This means that forms can be submitted before the JavaScript bundle is loaded.\n\nHandling return values in forms \n\nIn the username request form, there might be the chance that a username is not available. requestUsername should tell us if it fails or not.\n\nTo update the UI based on the result of a Server Action while supporting progressive enhancement, use useFormState.\n\n// requestUsername.js\n\n'use server';\n\n\n\nexport default async function requestUsername(formData) {\n\n  const username = formData.get('username');\n\n  if (canRequest(username)) {\n\n    // ...\n\n    return 'successful';\n\n  }\n\n  return 'failed';\n\n}\n// UsernameForm.js\n\n'use client';\n\n\n\nimport {useFormState} from 'react-dom';\n\nimport requestUsername from './requestUsername';\n\n\n\nfunction UsernameForm() {\n\n  const [returnValue, action] = useFormState(requestUsername, 'n/a');\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <form action={action}>\n\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" />\n\n        <button type=\"submit\">Request</button>\n\n      </form>\n\n      <p>Last submission request returned: {returnValue}</p>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNote that like most Hooks, useFormState can only be called in client code.\n\nCalling a Server Action outside of <form> \n\nServer Actions are exposed server endpoints and can be called anywhere in client code.\n\nWhen using a Server Action outside of a form, call the Server Action in a transition, which allows you to display a loading indicator, show optimistic state updates, and handle unexpected errors. Forms will automatically wrap Server Actions in transitions.\n\nimport incrementLike from './actions';\n\nimport { useState, useTransition } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction LikeButton() {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  const [likeCount, setLikeCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  const onClick = () => {\n\n    startTransition(async () => {\n\n      const currentCount = await incrementLike();\n\n      setLikeCount(currentCount);\n\n    });\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <p>Total Likes: {likeCount}</p>\n\n      <button onClick={onClick} disabled={isPending}>Like</button>;\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n// actions.js\n\n'use server';\n\n\n\nlet likeCount = 0;\n\nexport default async incrementLike() {\n\n  likeCount++;\n\n  return likeCount;\n\n}\n\nTo read a Server Action return value, you’ll need to await the promise returned.\n\nPREVIOUS\n'use client'"

Note that a single module may be evaluated on the server when imported from server code and on the client when imported from client code.\n\nCaveats \n'use client' must be at the very beginning of a file, above any imports or other code (comments are OK). They must be written with single or double quotes, but not backticks.\nWhen a 'use client' module is imported from another client-rendered module, the directive has no effect.\nWhen a component module contains a 'use client' directive, any usage of that component is guaranteed to be a Client Component. However, a component can still be evaluated on the client even if it does not have a 'use client' directive.\nA component usage is considered a Client Component if it is defined in module with 'use client' directive or when it is a transitive dependency of a module that contains a 'use client' directive. Otherwise, it is a Server Component.\nCode that is marked for client evaluation is not limited to components. All code that is a part of the Client module sub-tree is sent to and run by the client.\nWhen a server evaluated module imports values from a 'use client' module, the values must either be a React component or supported serializable prop values to be passed to a Client Component. Any other use case will throw an exception.\nHow 'use client' marks client code \n\nIn a React app, components are often split into separate files, or modules.\n\nFor apps that use React Server Components, the app is server-rendered by default. 'use client' introduces a server-client boundary in the module dependency tree, effectively creating a subtree of Client modules.\n\nTo better illustrate this, consider the following React Server Components app.\n\nApp.js\nFancyText.js\nInspirationGenerator.js\nCopyright.js\ninspirations.js\nReset\nFork\nimport FancyText from './FancyText';\nimport InspirationGenerator from './InspirationGenerator';\nimport Copyright from './Copyright';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <FancyText title text=\"Get Inspired App\" />\n      <InspirationGenerator>\n        <Copyright year={2004} />\n      </InspirationGenerator>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nIn the module dependency tree of this example app, the 'use client' directive in InspirationGenerator.js marks that module and all of its transitive dependencies as Client modules. The subtree starting at InspirationGenerator.js is now marked as Client modules.\n\n'use client' segments the module dependency tree of the React Server Components app, marking InspirationGenerator.js and all of its dependencies as client-rendered.\n\nDuring render, the framework will server-render the root component and continue through the render tree, opting-out of evaluating any code imported from client-marked code.\n\nThe server-rendered portion of the render tree is then sent to the client. The client, with its client code downloaded, then completes rendering the rest of the tree.\n\nThe render tree for the React Server Components app. InspirationGenerator and its child component FancyText are components exported from client-marked code and considered Client Components.\n\nWe introduce the following definitions:\n\nClient Components are components in a render tree that are rendered on the client.\nServer Components are components in a render tree that are rendered on the server.\n\nWorking through the example app, App, FancyText and Copyright are all server-rendered and considered Server Components. As InspirationGenerator.js and its transitive dependencies are marked as client code, the component InspirationGenerator and its child component FancyText are Client Components.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is FancyText both a Server and a Client Component? \nShow Details\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy is Copyright a Server Component? \nShow Details\nWhen to use 'use client' \n\nWith 'use client', you can determine when components are Client Components. As Server Components are default, here is a brief overview of the advantages and limitations to Server Components to determine when you need to mark something as client rendered.\n\nFor simplicity, we talk about Server Components, but the same principles apply to all code in your app that is server run.\n\nAdvantages of Server Components \nServer Components can reduce the amount of code sent and run by the client. Only Client modules are bundled and evaluated by the client.\nServer Components benefit from running on the server. They can access the local filesystem and may experience low latency for data fetches and network requests.\nLimitations of Server Components \nServer Components cannot support interaction as event handlers must be registered and triggered by a client.\nFor example, event handlers like onClick can only be defined in Client Components.\nServer Components cannot use most Hooks.\nWhen Server Components are rendered, their output is essentially a list of components for the client to render. Server Components do not persist in memory after render and cannot have their own state.\nSerializable types returned by Server Components \n\nAs in any React app, parent components pass data to child components. As they are rendered in different environments, passing data from a Server Component to a Client Component requires extra consideration.\n\nProp values passed from a Server Component to Client Component must be serializable.\n\nSerializable props include:\n\nPrimitives\nstring\nnumber\nbigint\nboolean\nundefined\nnull\nsymbol, only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via Symbol.for\nIterables containing serializable values\nString\nArray\nMap\nSet\nTypedArray and ArrayBuffer\nDate\nPlain objects: those created with object initializers, with serializable properties\nFunctions that are Server Actions\nClient or Server Component elements (JSX)\nPromises\n\nNotably, these are not supported:\n\nFunctions that are not exported from client-marked modules or marked with 'use server'\nClasses\nObjects that are instances of any class (other than the built-ins mentioned) or objects with a null prototype\nSymbols not registered globally, ex. Symbol('my new symbol')\nUsage \nBuilding with interactivity and state \nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter({initialValue = 0}) {\n  const [countValue, setCountValue] = useState(initialValue);\n  const increment = () => setCountValue(countValue + 1);\n  const decrement = () => setCountValue(countValue - 1);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Count Value: {countValue}</h2>\n      <button onClick={increment}>+1</button>\n      <button onClick={decrement}>-1</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nAs Counter requires both the useState Hook and event handlers to increment or decrement the value, this component must be a Client Component and will require a 'use client' directive at the top.\n\nIn contrast, a component that renders UI without interaction will not need to be a Client Component.\n\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';\n\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\n\n\nexport default async function CounterContainer() {\n\n  const initialValue = await readFile('/path/to/counter_value');\n\n  return <Counter initialValue={initialValue} />\n\n}\n\nFor example, Counter’s parent component, CounterContainer, does not require 'use client' as it is not interactive and does not use state. In addition, CounterContainer must be a Server Component as it reads from the local file system on the server, which is possible only in a Server Component.\n\nThere are also components that don’t use any server or client-only features and can be agnostic to where they render. In our earlier example, FancyText is one such component.\n\nexport default function FancyText({title, text}) {\n\n  return title\n\n    ? <h1 className='fancy title'>{text}</h1>\n\n    : <h3 className='fancy cursive'>{text}</h3>\n\n}\n\nIn this case, we don’t add the 'use client' directive, resulting in FancyText’s output (rather than its source code) to be sent to the browser when referenced from a Server Component. As demonstrated in the earlier Inspirations app example, FancyText is used as both a Server or Client Component, depending on where it is imported and used.\n\nBut if FancyText’s HTML output was large relative to its source code (including dependencies), it might be more efficient to force it to always be a Client Component. Components that return a long SVG path string are one case where it may be more efficient to force a component to be a Client Component.\n\nUsing client APIs \n\nYour React app may use client-specific APIs, such as the browser’s APIs for web storage, audio and video manipulation, and device hardware, among others.\n\nIn this example, the component uses DOM APIs to manipulate a canvas element. Since those APIs are only available in the browser, it must be marked as a Client Component.\n\n'use client';\n\n\n\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function Circle() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const canvas = ref.current;\n\n    const context = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\n    context.reset();\n\n    context.beginPath();\n\n    context.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);\n\n    context.stroke();\n\n  });\n\n  return <canvas ref={ref} />;\n\n}\nUsing third-party libraries \n\nOften in a React app, you’ll leverage third-party libraries to handle common UI patterns or logic.\n\nThese libraries may rely on component Hooks or client APIs. Third-party components that use any of the following React APIs must run on the client:\n\ncreateContext\nreact and react-dom Hooks, excluding use and useId\nforwardRef\nmemo\nstartTransition\nIf they use client APIs, ex. DOM insertion or native platform views\n\nIf these libraries have been updated to be compatible with React Server Components, then they will already include 'use client' markers of their own, allowing you to use them directly from your Server Components. If a library hasn’t been updated, or if a component needs props like event handlers that can only be specified on the client, you may need to add your own Client Component file in between the third-party Client Component and your Server Component where you’d like to use it.\n\nPREVIOUS\nDirectives\nNEXT\n'use server'"

New values created by uppercasing tainted values, concatenating tainted string values into a larger string, converting tainted values to base64, substringing tainted values, and other similar transformations are not tainted unless you explicitly call taintUniqueValue on these newly created values.\nDo not use taintUniqueValue to protect low-entropy values such as PIN codes or phone numbers. If any value in a request is controlled by an attacker, they could infer which value is tainted by enumerating all possible values of the secret.\nUsage \nPrevent a token from being passed to Client Components \n\nTo ensure that sensitive information such as passwords, session tokens, or other unique values do not inadvertently get passed to Client Components, the taintUniqueValue function provides a layer of protection. When a value is tainted, any attempt to pass it to a Client Component will result in an error.\n\nThe lifetime argument defines the duration for which the value remains tainted. For values that should remain tainted indefinitely, objects like globalThis or process can serve as the lifetime argument. These objects have a lifespan that spans the entire duration of your app’s execution.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n  'Do not pass a user password to the client.',\n\n  globalThis,\n\n  process.env.SECRET_KEY\n\n);\n\nIf the tainted value’s lifespan is tied to a object, the lifetime should be the object that encapsulates the value. This ensures the tainted value remains protected for the lifetime of the encapsulating object.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport async function getUser(id) {\n\n  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;\n\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n    'Do not pass a user session token to the client.',\n\n    user,\n\n    user.session.token\n\n  );\n\n  return user;\n\n}\n\nIn this example, the user object serves as the lifetime argument. If this object gets stored in a global cache or is accessible by another request, the session token remains tainted.\n\nPitfall\n\nDo not rely solely on tainting for security. Tainting a value doesn’t block every possible derived value. For example, creating a new value by upper casing a tainted string will not taint the new value.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst password = 'correct horse battery staple';\n\n\n\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n  'Do not pass the password to the client.',\n\n  globalThis,\n\n  password\n\n);\n\n\n\nconst uppercasePassword = password.toUpperCase() // `uppercasePassword` is not tainted\n\nIn this example, the constant password is tainted. Then password is used to create a new value uppercasePassword by calling the toUpperCase method on password. The newly created uppercasePassword is not tainted.\n\nOther similar ways of deriving new values from tainted values like concatenating it into a larger string, converting it to base64, or returning a substring create untained values.\n\nTainting only protects against simple mistakes like explicitly passing secret values to the client. Mistakes in calling the taintUniqueValue like using a global store outside of React, without the corresponding lifetime object, can cause the tainted value to become untainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nUsing server-only and taintUniqueValue to prevent leaking secrets \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nexperimental_taintObjectReference\nNEXT\nDirectives"

React immediately calls scope with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the scope function call as transitions. They will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators.\nReturns \n\nstartTransition does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nstartTransition does not provide a way to track whether a transition is pending. To show a pending indicator while the transition is ongoing, you need useTransition instead.\n\nYou can wrap an update into a transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook return value, try useDeferredValue instead.\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. React immediately executes this function, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as transitions. If you try to perform more state updates later (for example, in a timeout), they won’t be marked as transitions.\n\nA state update marked as a transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input state update.\n\nTransition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.\n\nIf there are multiple ongoing transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that will likely be removed in a future release.\n\nUsage \nMarking a state update as a non-blocking transition \n\nYou can mark a state update as a transition by wrapping it in a startTransition call:\n\nimport { startTransition } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction TabContainer() {\n\n  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');\n\n\n\n  function selectTab(nextTab) {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      setTab(nextTab);\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTransitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.\n\nWith a transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.\n\nNote\n\nstartTransition is very similar to useTransition, except that it does not provide the isPending flag to track whether a transition is ongoing. You can call startTransition when useTransition is not available. For example, startTransition works outside components, such as from a data library.\n\nLearn about transitions and see examples on the useTransition page.\n\nPREVIOUS\nmemo\nNEXT\nexperimental_taintObjectReference"

This memoized version of your component will usually not be re-rendered when its parent component is re-rendered as long as its props have not changed. But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee.\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst SomeComponent = memo(function SomeComponent(props) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nComponent: The component that you want to memoize. The memo does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead. Any valid React component, including functions and forwardRef components, is accepted.\n\noptional arePropsEqual: A function that accepts two arguments: the component’s previous props, and its new props. It should return true if the old and new props are equal: that is, if the component will render the same output and behave in the same way with the new props as with the old. Otherwise it should return false. Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with Object.is.\n\nReturns \n\nmemo returns a new React component. It behaves the same as the component provided to memo except that React will not always re-render it when its parent is being re-rendered unless its props have changed.\n\nUsage \nSkipping re-rendering when props are unchanged \n\nReact normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. With memo, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props are the same as the old props. Such a component is said to be memoized.\n\nTo memoize a component, wrap it in memo and use the value that it returns in place of your original component:\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\n});\n\n\n\nexport default Greeting;\n\nA React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using memo, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props haven’t changed. Even with memo, your component will re-render if its own state changes or if a context that it’s using changes.\n\nIn this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { memo, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  return <h3>Hello{name && ', '}{name}!</h3>;\n});\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on memo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add memo to improve performance.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add memo everywhere? \nShow Details\nUpdating a memoized component using state \n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when its own state changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { memo, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log('Greeting was rendered at', new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState('Hello');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h3>{greeting}{name && ', '}{name}!</h3>\n      <GreetingSelector value={greeting} onChange={setGreeting} />\n    </>\n  );\n});\n\nfunction GreetingSelector({ value, onChange }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"radio\"\n          checked={value === 'Hello'}\n          onChange={e => onChange('Hello')}\n        />\n        Regular greeting\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"radio\"\n          checked={value === 'Hello and welcome'}\n          onChange={e => onChange('Hello and welcome')}\n        />\n        Enthusiastic greeting\n      </label>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you set a state variable to its current value, React will skip re-rendering your component even without memo. You may still see your component function being called an extra time, but the result will be discarded.\n\nUpdating a memoized component using a context \n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it’s using changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { createContext, memo, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'); \n  }\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Switch theme\n      </button>\n      <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return (\n    <h3 className={theme}>Hello, {name}!</h3>\n  );\n});\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo make your component re-render only when a part of some context changes, split your component in two. Read what you need from the context in the outer component, and pass it down to a memoized child as a prop.\n\nMinimizing props changes \n\nWhen you use memo, your component re-renders whenever any prop is not shallowly equal to what it was previously. This means that React compares every prop in your component with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Note that Object.is(3, 3) is true, but Object.is({}, {}) is false.\n\nTo get the most out of memo, minimize the times that the props change. For example, if the prop is an object, prevent the parent component from re-creating that object every time by using useMemo:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n\n\n  const person = useMemo(\n\n    () => ({ name, age }),\n\n    [name, age]\n\n  );\n\n\n\n  return <Profile person={person} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Profile = memo(function Profile({ person }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nA better way to minimize props changes is to make sure the component accepts the minimum necessary information in its props. For example, it could accept individual values instead of a whole object:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  return <Profile name={name} age={age} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Profile = memo(function Profile({ name, age }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nEven individual values can sometimes be projected to ones that change less frequently. For example, here a component accepts a boolean indicating the presence of a value rather than the value itself:\n\nfunction GroupsLanding({ person }) {\n\n  const hasGroups = person.groups !== null;\n\n  return <CallToAction hasGroups={hasGroups} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst CallToAction = memo(function CallToAction({ hasGroups }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWhen you need to pass a function to memoized component, either declare it outside your component so that it never changes, or useCallback to cache its definition between re-renders.\n\nSpecifying a custom comparison function \n\nIn rare cases it may be infeasible to minimize the props changes of a memoized component. In that case, you can provide a custom comparison function, which React will use to compare the old and new props instead of using shallow equality. This function is passed as a second argument to memo. It should return true only if the new props would result in the same output as the old props; otherwise it should return false.\n\nconst Chart = memo(function Chart({ dataPoints }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}, arePropsEqual);\n\n\n\nfunction arePropsEqual(oldProps, newProps) {\n\n  return (\n\n    oldProps.dataPoints.length === newProps.dataPoints.length &&\n\n    oldProps.dataPoints.every((oldPoint, index) => {\n\n      const newPoint = newProps.dataPoints[index];\n\n      return oldPoint.x === newPoint.x && oldPoint.y === newPoint.y;\n\n    })\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf you do this, use the Performance panel in your browser developer tools to make sure that your comparison function is actually faster than re-rendering the component. You might be surprised.\n\nWhen you do performance measurements, make sure that React is running in the production mode.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf you provide a custom arePropsEqual implementation, you must compare every prop, including functions. Functions often close over the props and state of parent components. If you return true when oldProps.onClick !== newProps.onClick, your component will keep “seeing” the props and state from a previous render inside its onClick handler, leading to very confusing bugs.\n\nAvoid doing deep equality checks inside arePropsEqual unless you are 100% sure that the data structure you’re working with has a known limited depth. Deep equality checks can become incredibly slow and can freeze your app for many seconds if someone changes the data structure later.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component re-renders when a prop is an object, array, or function \n\nReact compares old and new props by shallow equality: that is, it considers whether each new prop is reference-equal to the old prop. If you create a new object or array each time the parent is re-rendered, even if the individual elements are each the same, React will still consider it to be changed. Similarly, if you create a new function when rendering the parent component, React will consider it to have changed even if the function has the same definition. To avoid this, simplify props or memoize props in the parent component.\n\nPREVIOUS\nlazy\nNEXT\nstartTransition"

After React first calls load, it will wait for it to resolve, and then render the resolved value’s .default as a React component. Both the returned Promise and the Promise’s resolved value will be cached, so React will not call load more than once. If the Promise rejects, React will throw the rejection reason for the nearest Error Boundary to handle.\nReturns \n\nlazy returns a React component you can render in your tree. While the code for the lazy component is still loading, attempting to render it will suspend.

It needs to eventually resolve to an object whose .default property is a valid React component type, such as a function, memo, or a forwardRef component.\n\nUsage \nLazy-loading components with Suspense \n\nUsually, you import components with the static import declaration:\n\nimport MarkdownPreview from './MarkdownPreview.js';\n\nTo defer loading this component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time, replace this import with:\n\nimport { lazy } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));\n\nThis code relies on dynamic import(), which might require support from your bundler or framework. Using this pattern requires that the lazy component you’re importing was exported as the default export.\n\nNow that your component’s code loads on demand, you also need to specify what should be displayed while it is loading. You can do this by wrapping the lazy component or any of its parents into a <Suspense> boundary:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <h2>Preview</h2>\n\n  <MarkdownPreview />\n\n </Suspense>\n\nIn this example, the code for MarkdownPreview won’t be loaded until you attempt to render it. If MarkdownPreview hasn’t loaded yet, Loading will be shown in its place.

The next time you untick and tick the checkbox, Preview will be cached, so there will be no loading state.

Unlike React components defined as plain functions, the component returned by forwardRef is able to take a ref prop.\n\nUsage \nExposing a DOM node to the parent component \n\nBy default, each component’s DOM nodes are private. However, sometimes it’s useful to expose a DOM node to the parent—for example, to allow focusing it. To opt in, wrap your component definition into forwardRef():\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input {...otherProps} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nYou will receive a ref as the second argument after props. Pass it to the DOM node that you want to expose:\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input {...otherProps} ref={ref} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nThis lets the parent Form component access the <input> DOM node exposed by MyInput:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    ref.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <MyInput label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} />\n\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Edit\n\n      </button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis Form component passes a ref to MyInput. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the <input> browser tag. As a result, the Form component can access that <input> DOM node and call focus() on it.\n\nKeep in mind that exposing a ref to the DOM node inside your component makes it harder to change your component’s internals later. You will typically expose DOM nodes from reusable low-level components like buttons or text inputs, but you won’t do it for application-level components like an avatar or a comment.\n\nExamples of forwarding a ref\n1. Focusing a text input\n2. Playing and pausing a video\nExample 1 of 2: Focusing a text input \n\nClicking the button will focus the input. The Form component defines a ref and passes it to the MyInput component. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the browser <input>. This lets the Form component focus the <input>.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nForwarding a ref through multiple components \n\nInstead of forwarding a ref to a DOM node, you can forward it to your own component like MyInput:\n\nconst FormField = forwardRef(function FormField(props, ref) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MyInput ref={ref} />\n\n      ...\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nIf that MyInput component forwards a ref to its <input>, a ref to FormField will give you that <input>:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    ref.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <FormField label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} isRequired={true} />\n\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Edit\n\n      </button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe Form component defines a ref and passes it to FormField. The FormField component forwards that ref to MyInput, which forwards it to a browser <input> DOM node. This is how Form accesses that DOM node.\n\nApp.js\nFormField.js\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport FormField from './FormField.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <FormField label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} isRequired={true} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExposing an imperative handle instead of a DOM node \n\nInstead of exposing an entire DOM node, you can expose a custom object, called an imperative handle, with a more constrained set of methods. To do this, you’d need to define a separate ref to hold the DOM node:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;\n\n});\n\nPass the ref you received to useImperativeHandle and specify the value you want to expose to the ref:\n\nimport { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      focus() {\n\n        inputRef.current.focus();\n\n      },\n\n      scrollIntoView() {\n\n        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();\n\n      },\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;\n\n});\n\nIf some component gets a ref to MyInput, it will only receive your { focus, scrollIntoView } object instead of the DOM node. This lets you limit the information you expose about your DOM node to the minimum.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:\n    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput placeholder=\"Enter your name\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nRead more about using imperative handles.\n\nPitfall\n\nDo not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.\n\nIf you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component is wrapped in forwardRef, but the ref to it is always null \n\nThis usually means that you forgot to actually use the ref that you received.\n\nFor example, this component doesn’t do anything with its ref:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nTo fix it, pass the ref down to a DOM node or another component that can accept a ref:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input ref={ref} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nThe ref to MyInput could also be null if some of the logic is conditional:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      {showInput && <input ref={ref} />}\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nIf showInput is false, then the ref won’t be forwarded to any node, and a ref to MyInput will remain empty. This is particularly easy to miss if the condition is hidden inside another component, like Panel in this example:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <Panel isExpanded={showInput}>\n\n        <input ref={ref} />\n\n      </Panel>\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\ncreateContext\nNEXT\nlazy"

If you don’t have any meaningful default value, specify null. The default value is meant as a “last resort” fallback. It is static and never changes over time.\nReturns \n\ncreateContext returns a context object.\n\nThe context object itself does not hold any information. It represents which context other components read or provide. Typically, you will use SomeContext.Provider in components above to specify the context value, and call useContext(SomeContext) in components below to read it. The context object has a few properties:\n\nSomeContext.Provider lets you provide the context value to components.\nSomeContext.Consumer is an alternative and rarely used way to read the context value.\nSomeContext.Provider \n\nWrap your components into a context provider to specify the value of this context for all components inside:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n\n  );\n\n}\nProps \nvalue: The value that you want to pass to all the components reading this context inside this provider, no matter how deep. The context value can be of any type. A component calling useContext(SomeContext) inside of the provider receives the value of the innermost corresponding context provider above it.\nSomeContext.Consumer \n\nBefore useContext existed, there was an older way to read context:\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  // 🟡 Legacy way (not recommended)\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext.Consumer>\n\n      {theme => (\n\n        <button className={theme} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </ThemeContext.Consumer>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlthough this older way still works, but newly written code should read context with useContext() instead:\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  // ✅ Recommended way\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return <button className={theme} />;\n\n}\nProps \nchildren: A function. React will call the function you pass with the current context value determined by the same algorithm as useContext() does, and render the result you return from this function. React will also re-run this function and update the UI whenever the context from the parent components changes.\nUsage \nCreating context \n\nContext lets components pass information deep down without explicitly passing props.\n\nCall createContext outside any components to create one or more contexts.\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nconst AuthContext = createContext(null);\n\ncreateContext returns a context object. Components can read context by passing it to useContext():\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Profile() {\n\n  const currentUser = useContext(AuthContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nBy default, the values they receive will be the default values you have specified when creating the contexts. However, by itself this isn’t useful because the default values never change.\n\nContext is useful because you can provide other, dynamic values from your components:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({ name: 'Taylor' });\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>\n\n      <AuthContext.Provider value={currentUser}>\n\n        <Page />\n\n      </AuthContext.Provider>\n\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow the Page component and any components inside it, no matter how deep, will “see” the passed context values. If the passed context values change, React will re-render the components reading the context as well.\n\nRead more about reading and providing context and see examples.\n\nImporting and exporting context from a file \n\nOften, components in different files will need access to the same context. This is why it’s common to declare contexts in a separate file. Then you can use the export statement to make context available for other files:\n\n// Contexts.js\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nexport const AuthContext = createContext(null);\n\nComponents declared in other files can then use the import statement to read or provide this context:\n\n// Button.js\n\nimport { ThemeContext } from './Contexts.js';\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// App.js\n\nimport { ThemeContext, AuthContext } from './Contexts.js';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>\n\n      <AuthContext.Provider value={currentUser}>\n\n        <Page />\n\n      </AuthContext.Provider>\n\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis works similar to importing and exporting components.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI can’t find a way to change the context value \n\nCode like this specifies the default context value:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nThis value never changes. React only uses this value as a fallback if it can’t find a matching provider above.\n\nTo make context change over time, add state and wrap components in a context provider.\n\nPREVIOUS\ncache\nNEXT\nforwardRef"

If getMetrics is called again with the same data, it will return the cached result instead of calling calculateMetrics(data) again.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nfn: The function you want to cache results for. fn can take any arguments and return any value.\nReturns \n\ncache returns a cached version of fn with the same type signature. It does not call fn in the process.\n\nWhen calling cachedFn with given arguments, it first checks if a cached result exists in the cache. If a cached result exists, it returns the result. If not, it calls fn with the arguments, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result. The only time fn is called is when there is a cache miss.\n\nNote\n\nThe optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as memoization. We refer to the function returned from cache as a memoized function.\n\nCaveats \nReact will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request.\nEach call to cache creates a new function. This means that calling cache with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache.\ncachedFn will also cache errors. If fn throws an error for certain arguments, it will be cached, and the same error is re-thrown when cachedFn is called with those same arguments.\ncache is for use in Server Components only.\nUsage \nCache an expensive computation \n\nUse cache to skip duplicate work.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport calculateUserMetrics from 'lib/user';\n\n\n\nconst getUserMetrics = cache(calculateUserMetrics);\n\n\n\nfunction Profile({user}) {\n\n  const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TeamReport({users}) {\n\n  for (let user in users) {\n\n    const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf the same user object is rendered in both Profile and TeamReport, the two components can share work and only call calculateUserMetrics once for that user.\n\nAssume Profile is rendered first. It will call getUserMetrics, and check if there is a cached result. Since it is the first time getUserMetrics is called with that user, there will be a cache miss. getUserMetrics will then call calculateUserMetrics with that user and write the result to cache.\n\nWhen TeamReport renders its list of users and reaches the same user object, it will call getUserMetrics and read the result from cache.\n\nPitfall\nCalling different memoized functions will read from different caches. \n\nTo access the same cache, components must call the same memoized function.\n\n// Temperature.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\nexport function Temperature({cityData}) {\n\n  // 🚩 Wrong: Calling `cache` in component creates new `getWeekReport` for each render\n\n  const getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// Precipitation.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: `getWeekReport` is only accessible for `Precipitation` component.\n\nconst getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);\n\n\n\nexport function Precipitation({cityData}) {\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, Precipitation and Temperature each call cache to create a new memoized function with their own cache look-up. If both components render for the same cityData, they will do duplicate work to call calculateWeekReport.\n\nIn addition, Temperature creates a new memoized function each time the component is rendered which doesn’t allow for any cache sharing.\n\nTo maximize cache hits and reduce work, the two components should call the same memoized function to access the same cache. Instead, define the memoized function in a dedicated module that can be import-ed across components.\n\n// getWeekReport.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\nexport default cache(calculateWeekReport);\n// Temperature.js\n\nimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';\n\n\n\nexport default function Temperature({cityData}) {\n\n\tconst report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// Precipitation.js\n\nimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';\n\n\n\nexport default function Precipitation({cityData}) {\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nHere, both components call the same memoized function exported from ./getWeekReport.js to read and write to the same cache.\n\nShare a snapshot of data \n\nTo share a snapshot of data between components, call cache with a data-fetching function like fetch. When multiple components make the same data fetch, only one request is made and the data returned is cached and shared across components. All components refer to the same snapshot of data across the server render.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {fetchTemperature} from './api.js';\n\n\n\nconst getTemperature = cache(async (city) => {\n\n\treturn await fetchTemperature(city);\n\n});\n\n\n\nasync function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nasync function MinimalWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\nIf AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard both render for the same city, they will receive the same snapshot of data from the memoized function.\n\nIf AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard supply different city arguments to getTemperature, then fetchTemperature will be called twice and each call site will receive different data.\n\nThe city acts as a cache key.\n\nNote\n\nAsynchronous rendering is only supported for Server Components.\n\nasync function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\nPreload data \n\nBy caching a long-running data fetch, you can kick off asynchronous work prior to rendering the component.\n\nconst getUser = cache(async (id) => {\n\n  return await db.user.query(id);\n\n}\n\n\n\nasync function Profile({id}) {\n\n  const user = await getUser(id);\n\n  return (\n\n    <section>\n\n      <img src={user.profilePic} />\n\n      <h2>{user.name}</h2>\n\n    </section>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Page({id}) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: start fetching the user data\n\n  getUser(id);\n\n  // ... some computational work\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Profile id={id} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWhen rendering Page, the component calls getUser but note that it doesn’t use the returned data. This early getUser call kicks off the asynchronous database query that occurs while Page is doing other computational work and rendering children.\n\nWhen rendering Profile, we call getUser again. If the initial getUser call has already returned and cached the user data, when Profile asks and waits for this data, it can simply read from the cache without requiring another remote procedure call. If the  initial data request hasn’t been completed, preloading data in this pattern reduces delay in data-fetching.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nCaching asynchronous work \nShow Details\nPitfall\nCalling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache. \nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst getUser = cache(async (userId) => {\n\n  return await db.user.query(userId);\n\n});\n\n\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: Calling memoized function outside of component will not memoize.\n\ngetUser('demo-id');\n\n\n\nasync function DemoProfile() {\n\n  // ✅ Good: `getUser` will memoize.\n\n  const user = await getUser('demo-id');\n\n  return <Profile user={user} />;\n\n}\n\nReact only provides cache access to the memoized function in a component. When calling getUser outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache.\n\nThis is because cache access is provided through a context which is only accessible from a component.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhen should I use cache, memo, or useMemo? \nShow Details\nTroubleshooting \nMy memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments \n\nSee prior mentioned pitfalls\n\nCalling different memoized functions will read from different caches.\nCalling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache.\n\nIf none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache.\n\nIf your arguments are not primitives (ex. objects, functions, arrays), ensure you’re passing the same object reference.\n\nWhen calling a memoized function, React will look up the input arguments to see if a result is already cached. React will use shallow equality of the arguments to determine if there is a cache hit.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // 🚩 Wrong: props is an object that changes every render.\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this case the two MapMarkers look like they’re doing the same work and calling calculateNorm with the same value of {x: 10, y: 10, z:10}. Even though the objects contain the same values, they are not the same object reference as each component creates its own props object.\n\nReact will call Object.is on the input to verify if there is a cache hit.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((x, y, z) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pass primitives to memoized function\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props.x, props.y, props.z);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nOne way to address this could be to pass the vector dimensions to calculateNorm. This works because the dimensions themselves are primitives.\n\nAnother solution may be to pass the vector object itself as a prop to the component. We’ll need to pass the same object to both component instances.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pass the same `vector` object\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props.vector);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const vector = [10, 10, 10];\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker vector={vector} />\n\n      <MapMarker vector={vector} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nAPIs\nNEXT\ncreateContext"

This gives you confidence that all components inside <StrictMode> are checked. If two teams working on a product disagree whether they find the checks valuable, they need to either reach consensus or move <StrictMode> down in the tree.\nUsage \nEnabling Strict Mode for entire app \n\nStrict Mode enables extra development-only checks for the entire component tree inside the <StrictMode> component. These checks help you find common bugs in your components early in the development process.\n\nTo enable Strict Mode for your entire app, wrap your root component with <StrictMode> when you render it:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(\n\n  <StrictMode>\n\n    <App />\n\n  </StrictMode>\n\n);\n\nWe recommend wrapping your entire app in Strict Mode, especially for newly created apps. If you use a framework that calls createRoot for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode.\n\nAlthough the Strict Mode checks only run in development, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.\n\nNote\n\nStrict Mode enables the following checks in development:\n\nYour components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.\nYour components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.\nYour components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.\n\nAll of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build.\n\nEnabling strict mode for a part of the app \n\nYou can also enable Strict Mode for any part of your application:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Header />\n\n      <StrictMode>\n\n        <main>\n\n          <Sidebar />\n\n          <Content />\n\n        </main>\n\n      </StrictMode>\n\n      <Footer />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example, Strict Mode checks will not run against the Header and Footer components. However, they will run on Sidebar and Content, as well as all of the components inside them, no matter how deep.\n\nFixing bugs found by double rendering in development \n\nReact assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context).\n\nComponents breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) twice in development. This includes:\n\nYour component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn’t include code inside event handlers)\nFunctions that you pass to useState, set functions, useMemo, or useReducer\nSome class component methods like constructor, render, shouldComponentUpdate (see the whole list)\n\nIf a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that’s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how double rendering in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nThis StoryTray component takes an array of stories and adds one last “Create Story” item at the end:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThere is a mistake in the code above. However, it is easy to miss because the initial output appears correct.\n\nThis mistake will become more noticeable if the StoryTray component re-renders multiple times. For example, let’s make the StoryTray re-render with a different background color whenever you hover over it:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const [isHover, setIsHover] = useState(false);\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul\n      onPointerEnter={() => setIsHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setIsHover(false)}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff'\n      }}\n    >\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how every time you hover over the StoryTray component, “Create Story” gets added to the list again. The intention of the code was to add it once at the end. But StoryTray directly modifies the stories array from the props. Every time StoryTray renders, it adds “Create Story” again at the end of the same array. In other words, StoryTray is not a pure function—running it multiple times produces different results.\n\nTo fix this problem, you can make a copy of the array, and modify that copy instead of the original one:\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n\n  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pushing into a new array\n\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n\nThis would make the StoryTray function pure. Each time it is called, it would only modify a new copy of the array, and would not affect any external objects or variables. This solves the bug, but you had to make the component re-render more often before it became obvious that something is wrong with its behavior.\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReset\nFork\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nStrict Mode always calls your rendering function twice, so you can see the mistake right away (“Create Story” appears twice). This lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your component to render in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the hover functionality from before:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const [isHover, setIsHover] = useState(false);\n  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul\n      onPointerEnter={() => setIsHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setIsHover(false)}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff'\n      }}\n    >\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you added more re-renders. Strict Mode made the same bug appear right away. Strict Mode helps you find bugs before you push them to your team and to your users.\n\nRead more about keeping components pure.\n\nNote\n\nIf you have React DevTools installed, any console.log calls during the second render call will appear slightly dimmed. React DevTools also offers a setting (off by default) to suppress them completely.\n\nFixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development \n\nStrict Mode can also help find bugs in Effects.\n\nEvery Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component mounts (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component unmounts (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nConsider this example that connects a component to a chat:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\nconst roomId = 'general';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n  }, []);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nThere is an issue with this code, but it might not be immediately clear.\n\nTo make the issue more obvious, let’s implement a feature. In the example below, roomId is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the roomId that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou’ll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that your Effect is missing a cleanup function:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\nNow that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved. However, notice that the problem did not become visible until you’ve added more features (the select box).\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\nconst roomId = 'general';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n  }, []);\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nWith Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem (the number of active connections jumps to 2). Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every Effect. This Effect has no cleanup logic, so it creates an extra connection but doesn’t destroy it. This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function.\n\nStrict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how the active connection count in the console doesn’t keep growing anymore.\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss that your Effect needed cleanup. By running setup → cleanup → setup instead of setup for your Effect in development, Strict Mode made the missing cleanup logic more noticeable.\n\nRead more about implementing Effect cleanup.\n\nFixing deprecation warnings enabled by Strict Mode \n\nReact warns if some component anywhere inside a <StrictMode> tree uses one of these deprecated APIs:\n\nfindDOMNode. See alternatives.\nUNSAFE_ class lifecycle methods like UNSAFE_componentWillMount. See alternatives.\nLegacy context (childContextTypes, contextTypes, and getChildContext). See alternatives.\nLegacy string refs (this.refs). See alternatives.\n\nThese APIs are primarily used in older class components so they rarely appear in modern apps.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<Profiler>\nNEXT\n<Suspense>"

If children suspends while rendering, the Suspense boundary will switch to rendering fallback.\nfallback: An alternate UI to render in place of the actual UI if it has not finished loading. Any valid React node is accepted, though in practice, a fallback is a lightweight placeholder view, such as a loading spinner or skeleton. Suspense will automatically switch to fallback when children suspends, and back to children when the data is ready. If fallback suspends while rendering, it will activate the closest parent Suspense boundary.\nCaveats \nReact does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time. When the component has loaded, React will retry rendering the suspended tree from scratch.\nIf Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the fallback will be shown again unless the update causing it was caused by startTransition or useDeferredValue.\nIf React needs to hide the already visible content because it suspended again, it will clean up layout Effects in the content tree. When the content is ready to be shown again, React will fire the layout Effects again. This ensures that Effects measuring the DOM layout don’t try to do this while the content is hidden.\nReact includes under-the-hood optimizations like Streaming Server Rendering and Selective Hydration that are integrated with Suspense. Read an architectural overview and watch a technical talk to learn more.\nUsage \nDisplaying a fallback while content is loading \n\nYou can wrap any part of your application with a Suspense boundary:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Albums />\n\n</Suspense>\n\nReact will display your loading fallback until all the code and data needed by the children has been loaded.\n\nIn the example below, the Albums component suspends while fetching the list of albums. Until it’s ready to render, React switches the closest Suspense boundary above to show the fallback—your Loading component. Then, when the data loads, React hides the Loading fallback and renders the Albums component with data.\n\nArtistPage.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Loading() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Albums component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nRevealing content together at once \n\nBy default, the whole tree inside Suspense is treated as a single unit. For example, even if only one of these components suspends waiting for some data, all of them together will be replaced by the loading indicator:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Biography />\n\n  <Panel>\n\n    <Albums />\n\n  </Panel>\n\n</Suspense>\n\nThen, after all of them are ready to be displayed, they will all appear together at once.\n\nIn the example below, both Biography and Albums fetch some data. However, because they are grouped under a single Suspense boundary, these components always “pop in” together at the same time.\n\nArtistPage.js\nPanel.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\nimport Biography from './Biography.js';\nimport Panel from './Panel.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <Biography artistId={artist.id} />\n        <Panel>\n          <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n        </Panel>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Loading() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nComponents that load data don’t have to be direct children of the Suspense boundary. For example, you can move Biography and Albums into a new Details component. This doesn’t change the behavior. Biography and Albums share the same closest parent Suspense boundary, so their reveal is coordinated together.\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Details artistId={artist.id} />\n\n</Suspense>\n\n\n\nfunction Details({ artistId }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Biography artistId={artistId} />\n\n      <Panel>\n\n        <Albums artistId={artistId} />\n\n      </Panel>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nRevealing nested content as it loads \n\nWhen a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense component shows the fallback. This lets you nest multiple Suspense components to create a loading sequence. Each Suspense boundary’s fallback will be filled in as the next level of content becomes available. For example, you can give the album list its own fallback:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n  <Biography />\n\n  <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>\n\n    <Panel>\n\n      <Albums />\n\n    </Panel>\n\n  </Suspense>\n\n</Suspense>\n\nWith this change, displaying the Biography doesn’t need to “wait” for the Albums to load.\n\nThe sequence will be:\n\nIf Biography hasn’t loaded yet, BigSpinner is shown in place of the entire content area.\nOnce Biography finishes loading, BigSpinner is replaced by the content.\nIf Albums hasn’t loaded yet, AlbumsGlimmer is shown in place of Albums and its parent Panel.\nFinally, once Albums finishes loading, it replaces AlbumsGlimmer.\nArtistPage.js\nPanel.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\nimport Biography from './Biography.js';\nimport Panel from './Panel.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n        <Biography artistId={artist.id} />\n        <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>\n          <Panel>\n            <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n          </Panel>\n        </Suspense>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\nfunction AlbumsGlimmer() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"glimmer-panel\">\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nSuspense boundaries let you coordinate which parts of your UI should always “pop in” together at the same time, and which parts should progressively reveal more content in a sequence of loading states. You can add, move, or delete Suspense boundaries in any place in the tree without affecting the rest of your app’s behavior.\n\nDon’t put a Suspense boundary around every component. Suspense boundaries should not be more granular than the loading sequence that you want the user to experience. If you work with a designer, ask them where the loading states should be placed—it’s likely that they’ve already included them in their design wireframes.\n\nShowing stale content while fresh content is loading \n\nIn this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Type \"a\", wait for the results, and then edit it to \"ab\". The results for \"a\" will get replaced by the loading fallback.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={query} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. The useDeferredValue Hook lets you pass a deferred version of the query down:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Search albums:\n\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.\n\nTo make it more obvious to the user, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:\n\n<div style={{\n\n  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1 \n\n}}>\n\n  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n</div>\n\nEnter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the dimmed stale result list until the new results have loaded:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <div style={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1 }}>\n          <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n        </div>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nBoth deferred values and transitions let you avoid showing Suspense fallback in favor of inline indicators. Transitions mark the whole update as non-urgent so they are typically used by frameworks and router libraries for navigation. Deferred values, on the other hand, are mostly useful in application code where you want to mark a part of UI as non-urgent and let it “lag behind” the rest of the UI.\n\nPreventing already revealed content from hiding \n\nWhen a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense boundary switches to showing the fallback. This can lead to a jarring user experience if it was already displaying some content. Try pressing this button:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    setPage(url);\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you pressed the button, the Router component rendered ArtistPage instead of IndexPage. A component inside ArtistPage suspended, so the closest Suspense boundary started showing the fallback. The closest Suspense boundary was near the root, so the whole site layout got replaced by BigSpinner.\n\nTo prevent this, you can mark the navigation state update as a transition with startTransition:\n\nfunction Router() {\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      setPage(url);      \n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis tells React that the state transition is not urgent, and it’s better to keep showing the previous page instead of hiding any already revealed content. Now clicking the button “waits” for the Biography to load:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, startTransition, useState } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA transition doesn’t wait for all content to load. It only waits long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content. For example, the website Layout was already revealed, so it would be bad to hide it behind a loading spinner. However, the nested Suspense boundary around Albums is new, so the transition doesn’t wait for it.\n\nNote\n\nSuspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into transitions by default.\n\nIndicating that a transition is happening \n\nIn the above example, once you click the button, there is no visual indication that a navigation is in progress. To add an indicator, you can replace startTransition with useTransition which gives you a boolean isPending value. In the example below, it’s used to change the website header styling while a transition is happening:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useTransition } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout isPending={isPending}>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nResetting Suspense boundaries on navigation \n\nDuring a transition, React will avoid hiding already revealed content. However, if you navigate to a route with different parameters, you might want to tell React it is different content. You can express this with a key:\n\n<ProfilePage key={queryParams.id} />\n\nImagine you’re navigating within a user’s profile page, and something suspends. If that update is wrapped in a transition, it will not trigger the fallback for already visible content. That’s the expected behavior.\n\nHowever, now imagine you’re navigating between two different user profiles. In that case, it makes sense to show the fallback. For example, one user’s timeline is different content from another user’s timeline. By specifying a key, you ensure that React treats different users’ profiles as different components, and resets the Suspense boundaries during navigation. Suspense-integrated routers should do this automatically.\n\nProviding a fallback for server errors and client-only content \n\nIf you use one of the streaming server rendering APIs (or a framework that relies on them), React will also use your <Suspense> boundaries to handle errors on the server. If a component throws an error on the server, React will not abort the server render. Instead, it will find the closest <Suspense> component above it and include its fallback (such as a spinner) into the generated server HTML. The user will see a spinner at first.\n\nOn the client, React will attempt to render the same component again. If it errors on the client too, React will throw the error and display the closest error boundary. However, if it does not error on the client, React will not display the error to the user since the content was eventually displayed successfully.\n\nYou can use this to opt out some components from rendering on the server. To do this, throw an error in the server environment and then wrap them in a <Suspense> boundary to replace their HTML with fallbacks:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Chat />\n\n</Suspense>\n\n\n\nfunction Chat() {\n\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n\n    throw Error('Chat should only render on the client.');\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe server HTML will include the loading indicator. It will be replaced by the Chat component on the client.\n\nTroubleshooting \nHow do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update? \n\nReplacing visible UI with a fallback creates a jarring user experience. This can happen when an update causes a component to suspend, and the nearest Suspense boundary is already showing content to the user.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, mark the update as non-urgent using startTransition. During a transition, React will wait until enough data has loaded to prevent an unwanted fallback from appearing:\n\nfunction handleNextPageClick() {\n\n  // If this update suspends, don't hide the already displayed content\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nThis will avoid hiding existing content. However, any newly rendered Suspense boundaries will still immediately display fallbacks to avoid blocking the UI and let the user see the content as it becomes available.\n\nReact will only prevent unwanted fallbacks during non-urgent updates. It will not delay a render if it’s the result of an urgent update. You must opt in with an API like startTransition or useDeferredValue.\n\nIf your router is integrated with Suspense, it should wrap its updates into startTransition automatically.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<StrictMode>\nNEXT\nAPIs"

    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment",
    "html": "API REFERENCE\nCOMPONENTS\n<Fragment> (<>...</>)\n\n<Fragment>, often used via <>...</> syntax, lets you group elements without a wrapper node.\n\n<>\n\n  <OneChild />\n\n  <AnotherChild />\n\n</>\nReference\n<Fragment>\nUsage\nReturning multiple elements\nAssigning multiple elements to a variable\nGrouping elements with text\nRendering a list of Fragments\nReference \n<Fragment> \n\nWrap elements in <Fragment> to group them together in situations where you need a single element. Grouping elements in Fragment has no effect on the resulting DOM; it is the same as if the elements were not grouped. The empty JSX tag <></> is shorthand for <Fragment></Fragment> in most cases.\n\nProps \noptional key: Fragments declared with the explicit <Fragment> syntax may have keys.\nCaveats \n\nIf you want to pass key to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment>.\n\nReact does not reset state when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to [<Child />] or back, or when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to <Child /> and back. This only works a single level deep: for example, going from <><><Child /></></> to <Child /> resets the state. See the precise semantics here.\n\nUsage \nReturning multiple elements \n\nUse Fragment, or the equivalent <>...</> syntax, to group multiple elements together. You can use it to put multiple elements in any place where a single element can go. For example, a component can only return one element, but by using a Fragment you can group multiple elements together and then return them as a group:\n\nfunction Post() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <PostTitle />\n\n      <PostBody />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nFragments are useful because grouping elements with a Fragment has no effect on layout or styles, unlike if you wrapped the elements in another container like a DOM element. If you inspect this example with the browser tools, you’ll see that all <h1> and <article> DOM nodes appear as siblings without wrappers around them:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nexport default function Blog() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Post title=\"An update\" body=\"It's been a while since I posted...\" />\n      <Post title=\"My new blog\" body=\"I am starting a new blog!\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Post({ title, body }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <PostTitle title={title} />\n      <PostBody body={body} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PostTitle({ title }) {\n  return <h1>{title}</h1>\n}\n\nfunction PostBody({ body }) {\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <p>{body}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to write a Fragment without the special syntax? \nShow Details\nAssigning multiple elements to a variable \n\nLike any other element, you can assign Fragment elements to variables, pass them as props, and so on:\n\nfunction CloseDialog() {\n\n  const buttons = (\n\n    <>\n\n      <OKButton />\n\n      <CancelButton />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n  return (\n\n    <AlertDialog buttons={buttons}>\n\n      Are you sure you want to leave this page?\n\n    </AlertDialog>\n\n  );\n\n}\nGrouping elements with text \n\nYou can use Fragment to group text together with components:\n\nfunction DateRangePicker({ start, end }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      From\n\n      <DatePicker date={start} />\n\n      to\n\n      <DatePicker date={end} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nRendering a list of Fragments \n\nHere’s a situation where you need to write Fragment explicitly instead of using the <></> syntax. When you render multiple elements in a loop, you need to assign a key to each element. If the elements within the loop are Fragments, you need to use the normal JSX element syntax in order to provide the key attribute:\n\nfunction Blog() {\n\n  return posts.map(post =>\n\n    <Fragment key={post.id}>\n\n      <PostTitle title={post.title} />\n\n      <PostBody body={post.body} />\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou can inspect the DOM to verify that there are no wrapper elements around the Fragment children:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { Fragment } from 'react';\n\nconst posts = [\n  { id: 1, title: 'An update', body: \"It's been a while since I posted...\" },\n  { id: 2, title: 'My new blog', body: 'I am starting a new blog!' }\n];\n\nexport default function Blog() {\n  return posts.map(post =>\n    <Fragment key={post.id}>\n      <PostTitle title={post.title} />\n      <PostBody body={post.body} />\n    </Fragment>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PostTitle({ title }) {\n  return <h1>{title}</h1>\n}\n\nfunction PostBody({ body }) {\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <p>{body}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nComponents\nNEXT\n<Profiler>"

React immediately calls scope with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the scope function call as transitions. They will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators.\nReturns \n\nstartTransition does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nuseTransition is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone startTransition instead.\n\nYou can wrap an update into a transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try useDeferredValue instead.\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. React immediately executes this function, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as transitions. If you try to perform more state updates later (for example, in a timeout), they won’t be marked as transitions.\n\nA state update marked as a transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input update.\n\nTransition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.\n\nIf there are multiple ongoing transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that will likely be removed in a future release.\n\nUsage \nMarking a state update as a non-blocking transition \n\nCall useTransition at the top level of your component to mark state updates as non-blocking transitions.\n\nimport { useState, useTransition } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction TabContainer() {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nuseTransition returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending transition.\nThe startTransition function that lets you mark a state update as a transition.\n\nYou can then mark a state update as a transition like this:\n\nfunction TabContainer() {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');\n\n\n\n  function selectTab(nextTab) {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      setTab(nextTab);\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTransitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.\n\nWith a transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.\n\nThe difference between useTransition and regular state updates\n1. Updating the current tab in a transition\n2. Updating the current tab without a transition\nExample 1 of 2: Updating the current tab in a transition \n\nIn this example, the “Posts” tab is artificially slowed down so that it takes at least a second to render.\n\nClick “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact”. Notice that this interrupts the slow render of “Posts”. The “Contact” tab shows immediately. Because this state update is marked as a transition, a slow re-render did not freeze the user interface.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useTransition } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport AboutTab from './AboutTab.js';\nimport PostsTab from './PostsTab.js';\nimport ContactTab from './ContactTab.js';\n\nexport default function TabContainer() {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');\n\n  function selectTab(nextTab) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setTab(nextTab);\n    });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'about'}\n        onClick={() => selectTab('about')}\n      >\n        About\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'posts'}\n        onClick={() => selectTab('posts')}\n      >\n        Posts (slow)\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'contact'}\n        onClick={() => selectTab('contact')}\n      >\n        Contact\n      </TabButton>\n      <hr />\n      {tab === 'about' && <AboutTab />}\n      {tab === 'posts' && <PostsTab />}\n      {tab === 'contact' && <ContactTab />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating the parent component in a transition \n\nYou can update a parent component’s state from the useTransition call, too. For example, this TabButton component wraps its onClick logic in a transition:\n\nexport default function TabButton({ children, isActive, onClick }) {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  if (isActive) {\n\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n\n  }\n\n  return (\n\n    <button onClick={() => {\n\n      startTransition(() => {\n\n        onClick();\n\n      });\n\n    }}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBecause the parent component updates its state inside the onClick event handler, that state update gets marked as a transition. This is why, like in the earlier example, you can click on “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact”. Updating the selected tab is marked as a transition, so it does not block user interactions.\n\nTabButton.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from 'react';\n\nexport default function TabButton({ children, isActive, onClick }) {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  if (isActive) {\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n  }\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      startTransition(() => {\n        onClick();\n      });\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDisplaying a pending visual state during the transition \n\nYou can use the isPending boolean value returned by useTransition to indicate to the user that a transition is in progress.

Learn more about React’s release channels here.\n\nIf a function passed to startTransition throws an error, you can display an error to your user with an error boundary. To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the useTransition in an error boundary. Once the function passed to startTransition errors, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.\n\nAddCommentContainer.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nexport function AddCommentContainer() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️Something went wrong</p>}>\n        <AddCommentButton />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction addComment(comment) {\n  // For demonstration purposes to show Error Boundary\n  if(comment == null){\n    throw Error('Example error')\n  }\n}\n\nfunction AddCommentButton() {\n  const [pending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      disabled={pending}\n      onClick={() => {\n        startTransition(() => {\n          // Intentionally not passing a comment\n          // so error gets thrown\n          addComment();\n        });\n      }}>\n        Add comment\n      </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nTroubleshooting \nUpdating an input in a transition doesn’t work \n\nYou can’t use a transition for a state variable that controls an input:\n\nconst [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n// ...\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // ❌ Can't use transitions for controlled input state\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setText(e.target.value);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n// ...\n\nreturn <input value={text} onChange={handleChange} />;\n\nThis is because transitions are non-blocking, but updating an input in response to the change event should happen synchronously. If you want to run a transition in response to typing, you have two options:\n\nYou can declare two separate state variables: one for the input state (which always updates synchronously), and one that you will update in a transition. This lets you control the input using the synchronous state, and pass the transition state variable (which will “lag behind” the input) to the rest of your rendering logic.\nAlternatively, you can have one state variable, and add useDeferredValue which will “lag behind” the real value. It will trigger non-blocking re-renders to “catch up” with the new value automatically.\nReact doesn’t treat my state update as a transition \n\nWhen you wrap a state update in a transition, make sure that it happens during the startTransition call:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous.\n\nYou can’t mark an update as a transition like this:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  // ❌ Setting state *after* startTransition call\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  }, 1000);\n\n});\n\nInstead, you could do this:\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  });\n\n}, 1000);\n\nSimilarly, you can’t mark an update as a transition like this:\n\nstartTransition(async () => {\n\n  await someAsyncFunction();\n\n  // ❌ Setting state *after* startTransition call\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nHowever, this works instead:\n\nawait someAsyncFunction();\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\nI want to call useTransition from outside a component \n\nYou can’t call useTransition outside a component because it’s a Hook. In this case, use the standalone startTransition method instead. It works the same way, but it doesn’t provide the isPending indicator.\n\nThe function I pass to startTransition executes immediately \n\nIf you run this code, it will print 1, 2, 3:\n\nconsole.log(1);\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  console.log(2);\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nconsole.log(3);\n\nIt is expected to print 1, 2, 3. The function you pass to startTransition does not get delayed. Unlike with the browser setTimeout, it does not run the callback later. React executes your function immediately, but any state updates scheduled while it is running are marked as transitions. You can imagine that it works like this:\n\n// A simplified version of how React works\n\n\n\nlet isInsideTransition = false;\n\n\n\nfunction startTransition(scope) {\n\n  isInsideTransition = true;\n\n  scope();\n\n  isInsideTransition = false;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction setState() {\n\n  if (isInsideTransition) {\n\n    // ... schedule a transition state update ...\n\n  } else {\n\n    // ... schedule an urgent state update ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nuseSyncExternalStore\nNEXT\nComponents"

You need to pass two functions as arguments:\n\nThe subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.\nThe getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nsubscribe: A function that takes a single callback argument and subscribes it to the store. When the store changes, it should invoke the provided callback. This will cause the component to re-render. The subscribe function should return a function that cleans up the subscription.\n\ngetSnapshot: A function that returns a snapshot of the data in the store that’s needed by the component. While the store has not changed, repeated calls to getSnapshot must return the same value. If the store changes and the returned value is different (as compared by Object.is), React re-renders the component.\n\noptional getServerSnapshot: A function that returns the initial snapshot of the data in the store. It will be used only during server rendering and during hydration of server-rendered content on the client. The server snapshot must be the same between the client and the server, and is usually serialized and passed from the server to the client. If you omit this argument, rendering the component on the server will throw an error.\n\nReturns \n\nThe current snapshot of the store which you can use in your rendering logic.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe store snapshot returned by getSnapshot must be immutable. If the underlying store has mutable data, return a new immutable snapshot if the data has changed. Otherwise, return a cached last snapshot.\n\nIf a different subscribe function is passed during a re-render, React will re-subscribe to the store using the newly passed subscribe function. You can prevent this by declaring subscribe outside the component.\n\nIf the store is mutated during a non-blocking transition update, React will fall back to performing that update as blocking. Specifically, for every transition update, React will call getSnapshot a second time just before applying changes to the DOM. If it returns a different value than when it was called originally, React will restart the update from scratch, this time applying it as a blocking update, to ensure that every component on screen is reflecting the same version of the store.\n\nIt’s not recommended to suspend a render based on a store value returned by useSyncExternalStore. The reason is that mutations to the external store cannot be marked as non-blocking transition updates, so they will trigger the nearest Suspense fallback, replacing already-rendered content on screen with a loading spinner, which typically makes a poor UX.\n\nFor example, the following are discouraged:\n\nconst LazyProductDetailPage = lazy(() => import('./ProductDetailPage.js'));\n\n\n\nfunction ShoppingApp() {\n\n  const selectedProductId = useSyncExternalStore(...);\n\n\n\n  // ❌ Calling `use` with a Promise dependent on `selectedProductId`\n\n  const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId))\n\n\n\n  // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId`\n\n  return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> : <FeaturedProducts />;\n\n}\nUsage \nSubscribing to an external store \n\nMost of your React components will only read data from their props, state, and context. However, sometimes a component needs to read some data from some store outside of React that changes over time. This includes:\n\nThird-party state management libraries that hold state outside of React.\nBrowser APIs that expose a mutable value and events to subscribe to its changes.\n\nCall useSyncExternalStore at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store.\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nimport { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';\n\n\n\nfunction TodosApp() {\n\n  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIt returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments:\n\nThe subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.\nThe getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.\n\nReact will use these functions to keep your component subscribed to the store and re-render it on changes.\n\nFor example, in the sandbox below, todosStore is implemented as an external store that stores data outside of React. The TodosApp component connects to that external store with the useSyncExternalStore Hook.\n\nApp.js\ntodoStore.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\nimport { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';\n\nexport default function TodosApp() {\n  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => todosStore.addTodo()}>Add todo</button>\n      <hr />\n      <ul>\n        {todos.map(todo => (\n          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nWhen possible, we recommend using built-in React state with useState and useReducer instead. The useSyncExternalStore API is mostly useful if you need to integrate with existing non-React code.\n\nSubscribing to a browser API \n\nAnother reason to add useSyncExternalStore is when you want to subscribe to some value exposed by the browser that changes over time. For example, suppose that you want your component to display whether the network connection is active. The browser exposes this information via a property called navigator.onLine.\n\nThis value can change without React’s knowledge, so you should read it with useSyncExternalStore.\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTo implement the getSnapshot function, read the current value from the browser API:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  return navigator.onLine;\n\n}\n\nNext, you need to implement the subscribe function. For example, when navigator.onLine changes, the browser fires the online and offline events on the window object. You need to subscribe the callback argument to the corresponding events, and then return a function that cleans up the subscriptions:\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  return () => {\n\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nNow React knows how to read the value from the external navigator.onLine API and how to subscribe to its changes. Disconnect your device from the network and notice that the component re-renders in response:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nexport default function ChatIndicator() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExtracting the logic to a custom Hook \n\nUsually you won’t write useSyncExternalStore directly in your components. Instead, you’ll typically call it from your own custom Hook. This lets you use the same external store from different components.\n\nFor example, this custom useOnlineStatus Hook tracks whether the network is online:\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow different components can call useOnlineStatus without repeating the underlying implementation:\n\nApp.js\nuseOnlineStatus.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SaveButton />\n      <StatusBar />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nAdding support for server rendering \n\nIf your React app uses server rendering, your React components will also run outside the browser environment to generate the initial HTML. This creates a few challenges when connecting to an external store:\n\nIf you’re connecting to a browser-only API, it won’t work because it does not exist on the server.\nIf you’re connecting to a third-party data store, you’ll need its data to match between the server and client.\n\nTo solve these issues, pass a getServerSnapshot function as the third argument to useSyncExternalStore:\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  return navigator.onLine;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getServerSnapshot() {\n\n  return true; // Always show \"Online\" for server-generated HTML\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe getServerSnapshot function is similar to getSnapshot, but it runs only in two situations:\n\nIt runs on the server when generating the HTML.\nIt runs on the client during hydration, i.e. when React takes the server HTML and makes it interactive.\n\nThis lets you provide the initial snapshot value which will be used before the app becomes interactive. If there is no meaningful initial value for the server rendering, omit this argument to force rendering on the client.\n\nNote\n\nMake sure that getServerSnapshot returns the same exact data on the initial client render as it returned on the server. For example, if getServerSnapshot returned some prepopulated store content on the server, you need to transfer this content to the client. One way to do this is to emit a <script> tag during server rendering that sets a global like window.MY_STORE_DATA, and read from that global on the client in getServerSnapshot. Your external store should provide instructions on how to do that.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “The result of getSnapshot should be cached” \n\nThis error means your getSnapshot function returns a new object every time it’s called, for example:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // 🔴 Do not return always different objects from getSnapshot\n\n  return {\n\n    todos: myStore.todos\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nReact will re-render the component if getSnapshot return value is different from the last time. This is why, if you always return a different value, you will enter an infinite loop and get this error.\n\nYour getSnapshot object should only return a different object if something has actually changed. If your store contains immutable data, you can return that data directly:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // ✅ You can return immutable data\n\n  return myStore.todos;\n\n}\n\nIf your store data is mutable, your getSnapshot function should return an immutable snapshot of it. This means it does need to create new objects, but it shouldn’t do this for every single call. Instead, it should store the last calculated snapshot, and return the same snapshot as the last time if the data in the store has not changed. How you determine whether mutable data has changed depends on your mutable store.\n\nMy subscribe function gets called after every re-render \n\nThis subscribe function is defined inside a component so it is different on every re-render:\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  \n\n  // 🚩 Always a different function, so React will resubscribe on every re-render\n\n  function subscribe() {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReact will resubscribe to your store if you pass a different subscribe function between re-renders. If this causes performance issues and you’d like to avoid resubscribing, move the subscribe function outside:\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\n// ✅ Always the same function, so React won't need to resubscribe\n\nfunction subscribe() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, wrap subscribe into useCallback to only resubscribe when some argument changes:\n\nfunction ChatIndicator({ userId }) {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  \n\n  // ✅ Same function as long as userId doesn't change\n\n  const subscribe = useCallback(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, [userId]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nuseState\nNEXT\nuseTransition"

It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.\nIf you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. See an example below.\nReturns \n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.\nThe set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.\nCaveats \nuseState is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your initializer function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your initializer function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\nset functions, like setSomething(nextState) \n\nThe set function returned by useState lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:\n\nconst [name, setName] = useState('Edward');\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Taylor');\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1);\n\n  // ...\nParameters \nnextState: The value that you want the state to be. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions.\nIf you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. See an example below.\nReturns \n\nset functions do not have a return value.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe set function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the set function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.\n\nIf the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn’t affect your code.\n\nReact batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.\n\nCalling the set function during rendering is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to store information from the previous renders. See an example below.\n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your updater function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your updater function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\n\nUsage \nAdding state to a component \n\nCall useState at the top level of your component to declare one or more state variables.\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  // ...\n\nThe convention is to name state variables like [something, setSomething] using array destructuring.\n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.\nThe set function that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call the set function with some next state:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Robin');\n\n}\n\nReact will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.\n\nPitfall\n\nCalling the set function does not change the current state in the already executing code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Robin');\n\n  console.log(name); // Still \"Taylor\"!\n\n}\n\nIt only affects what useState will return starting from the next render.\n\nBasic useState examples\n1. Counter (number)\n2. Text field (string)\n3. Checkbox (boolean)\n4. Form (two variables)\nExample 1 of 4: Counter (number) \n\nIn this example, the count state variable holds a number. Clicking the button increments it.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      You pressed me {count} times\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNext Example\nUpdating state based on the previous state \n\nSuppose the age is 42. This handler calls setAge(age + 1) three times:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n}\n\nHowever, after one click, age will only be 43 rather than 45! This is because calling the set function does not update the age state variable in the already running code. So each setAge(age + 1) call becomes setAge(43).\n\nTo solve this problem, you may pass an updater function to setAge instead of the next state:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)\n\n}\n\nHere, a => a + 1 is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.\n\nReact puts your updater functions in a queue. Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:\n\na => a + 1 will receive 42 as the pending state and return 43 as the next state.\na => a + 1 will receive 43 as the pending state and return 44 as the next state.\na => a + 1 will receive 44 as the pending state and return 45 as the next state.\n\nThere are no other queued updates, so React will store 45 as the current state in the end.\n\nBy convention, it’s common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like a for age. However, you may also call it like prevAge or something else that you find clearer.\n\nReact may call your updaters twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nIs using an updater always preferred? \nShow Details\nThe difference between passing an updater and passing the next state directly\n1. Passing the updater function\n2. Passing the next state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the updater function \n\nThis example passes the updater function, so the “+3” button works.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  function increment() {\n    setAge(a => a + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Your age: {age}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        increment();\n        increment();\n        increment();\n      }}>+3</button>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        increment();\n      }}>+1</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating objects and arrays in state \n\nYou can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so you should replace it rather than mutate your existing objects. For example, if you have a form object in state, don’t mutate it:\n\n// 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:\n\nform.firstName = 'Taylor';\n\nInstead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:\n\n// ✅ Replace state with a new object\n\nsetForm({\n\n  ...form,\n\n  firstName: 'Taylor'\n\n});\n\nRead updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.\n\nExamples of objects and arrays in state\n1. Form (object)\n2. Form (nested object)\n3. List (array)\n4. Writing concise update logic with Immer\nExample 1 of 4: Form (object) \n\nIn this example, the form state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls setForm with the next state of the entire form. The { ...form } spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [form, setForm] = useState({\n    firstName: 'Barbara',\n    lastName: 'Hepworth',\n    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input\n          value={form.firstName}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              firstName: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input\n          value={form.lastName}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              lastName: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Email:\n        <input\n          value={form.email}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              email: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <p>\n        {form.firstName}{' '}\n        {form.lastName}{' '}\n        ({form.email})\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nAvoiding recreating the initial state \n\nReact saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos());\n\n  // ...\n\nAlthough the result of createInitialTodos() is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.\n\nTo solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useState instead:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice that you’re passing createInitialTodos, which is the function itself, and not createInitialTodos(), which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to useState, React will only call it during initialization.\n\nReact may call your initializers twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nThe difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly\n1. Passing the initializer function\n2. Passing the initial state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the initializer function \n\nThis example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialTodos function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction createInitialTodos() {\n  const initialTodos = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n    initialTodos.push({\n      id: i,\n      text: 'Item ' + (i + 1)\n    });\n  }\n  return initialTodos;\n}\n\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={text}\n        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setText('');\n        setTodos([{\n          id: todos.length,\n          text: text\n        }, ...todos]);\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {todos.map(item => (\n          <li key={item.id}>\n            {item.text}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nResetting state with a key \n\nYou’ll often encounter the key attribute when rendering lists. However, it also serves another purpose.\n\nYou can reset a component’s state by passing a different key to a component. In this example, the Reset button changes the version state variable, which we pass as a key to the Form. When the key changes, React re-creates the Form component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.\n\nRead preserving and resetting state to learn more.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [version, setVersion] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleReset() {\n    setVersion(version + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>\n      <Form key={version} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <p>Hello, {name}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nStoring information from previous renders \n\nUsually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering — for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.\n\nIn most cases, you don’t need this:\n\nIf the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, remove that redundant state altogether. If you’re worried about recomputing too often, the useMemo Hook can help.\nIf you want to reset the entire component tree’s state, pass a different key to your component.\nIf you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers.\n\nIn the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a set function while your component is rendering.\n\nHere’s an example. This CountLabel component displays the count prop passed to it:\n\nexport default function CountLabel({ count }) {\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>\n\n}\n\nSay you want to show whether the counter has increased or decreased since the last change. The count prop doesn’t tell you this — you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the prevCount state variable to track it. Add another state variable called trend to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare prevCount with count, and if they’re not equal, update both prevCount and trend. Now you can show both the current count prop and how it has changed since the last render.\n\nCountLabel.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function CountLabel({ count }) {\n  const [prevCount, setPrevCount] = useState(count);\n  const [trend, setTrend] = useState(null);\n  if (prevCount !== count) {\n    setPrevCount(count);\n    setTrend(count > prevCount ? 'increasing' : 'decreasing');\n  }\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{count}</h1>\n      {trend && <p>The count is {trend}</p>}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that if you call a set function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like prevCount !== count, and there must be a call like setPrevCount(count) inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the currently rendering component like this. Calling the set function of another component during rendering is an error. Finally, your set call should still update state without mutation — this doesn’t mean you can break other rules of pure functions.\n\nThis pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it’s better than updating state in an effect. When you call the set function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a return statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don’t need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early return; to restart rendering earlier.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value \n\nCalling the set function does not change state in the running code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(count);  // 0\n\n\n\n  setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1\n\n  console.log(count);  // Still 0!\n\n\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    console.log(count); // Also 0!\n\n  }, 5000);\n\n}\n\nThis is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the count JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.\n\nIf you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the set function:\n\nconst nextCount = count + 1;\n\nsetCount(nextCount);\n\n\n\nconsole.log(count);     // 0\n\nconsole.log(nextCount); // 1\nI’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update \n\nReact will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:\n\nobj.x = 10;  // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\nsetObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything\n\nYou mutated an existing obj object and passed it back to setObj, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always replacing objects and arrays in state instead of mutating them:\n\n// ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\nsetObj({\n\n  ...obj,\n\n  x: 10\n\n});\nI’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” \n\nYou might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state during render, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function\n\nreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n\nIf you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific set function call responsible for the error.\n\nMy initializer or updater function runs twice \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  // This component function will run twice for every render.\n\n\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => {\n\n    // This initializer function will run twice during initialization.\n\n    return createTodos();\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n      // This updater function will run twice for every click.\n\n      return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is expected and shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.\n\nFor example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:\n\nsetTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n  // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state\n\n  prevTodos.push(createTodo());\n\n});\n\nBecause React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:\n\nsetTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n  // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state\n\n  return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];\n\n});\n\nNow that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more.\n\nI’m trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead \n\nYou can’t put a function into state like this:\n\nconst [fn, setFn] = useState(someFunction);\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setFn(someOtherFunction);\n\n}\n\nBecause you’re passing a function, React assumes that someFunction is an initializer function, and that someOtherFunction is an updater function, so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually store a function, you have to put () => before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.\n\nconst [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setFn(() => someOtherFunction);\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nuseRef\nNEXT\nuseSyncExternalStore"

It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.\nReturns \n\nuseRef returns an object with a single property:\n\ncurrent: Initially, it’s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.\n\nOn the next renders, useRef will return the same object.\n\nCaveats \nYou can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn’t mutate that object.\nWhen you change the ref.current property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.\nDo not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization. This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your component function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.\nUsage \nReferencing a value with a ref \n\nCall useRef at the top level of your component to declare one or more refs.\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Stopwatch() {\n\n  const intervalRef = useRef(0);\n\n  // ...\n\nuseRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.\n\nOn the next renders, useRef will return the same object. You can change its current property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of state, but there is an important difference.\n\nChanging a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property:\n\nfunction handleStartClick() {\n\n  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, 1000);\n\n  intervalRef.current = intervalId;\n\n}\n\nLater, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call clear that interval:\n\nfunction handleStopClick() {\n\n  const intervalId = intervalRef.current;\n\n  clearInterval(intervalId);\n\n}\n\nBy using a ref, you ensure that:\n\nYou can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).\nChanging it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).\nThe information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).\n\nChanging a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead. Read more about choosing between useRef and useState.\n\nExamples of referencing a value with useRef\n1. Click counter\n2. A stopwatch\nExample 1 of 2: Click counter \n\nThis component uses a ref to keep track of how many times the button was clicked. Note that it’s okay to use a ref instead of state here because the click count is only read and written in an event handler.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  let ref = useRef(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current = ref.current + 1;\n    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      Click me!\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you show {ref.current} in the JSX, the number won’t update on click. This is because setting ref.current does not trigger a re-render. Information that’s used for rendering should be state instead.\n\nNext Example\nPitfall\n\nDo not write or read ref.current during rendering.\n\nReact expects that the body of your component behaves like a pure function:\n\nIf the inputs (props, state, and context) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.\nCalling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.\n\nReading or writing a ref during rendering breaks these expectations.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🚩 Don't write a ref during rendering\n\n  myRef.current = 123;\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🚩 Don't read a ref during rendering\n\n  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>;\n\n}\n\nYou can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ✅ You can read or write refs in effects\n\n    myRef.current = 123;\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    // ✅ You can read or write refs in event handlers\n\n    doSomething(myOtherRef.current);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf you have to read or write something during rendering, use state instead.\n\nWhen you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features we’re adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about keeping your components pure.\n\nManipulating the DOM with a ref \n\nIt’s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the DOM. React has built-in support for this.\n\nFirst, declare a ref object with an initial value of null:\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\n\nThen pass your ref object as the ref attribute to the JSX of the DOM node you want to manipulate:\n\n  // ...\n\n  return <input ref={inputRef} />;\n\nAfter React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set the current property of your ref object to that DOM node. Now you can access the <input>’s DOM node and call methods like focus():\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\nReact will set the current property back to null when the node is removed from the screen.\n\nRead more about manipulating the DOM with refs.\n\nExamples of manipulating the DOM with useRef\n1. Focusing a text input\n2. Scrolling an image into view\n3. Playing and pausing a video\n4. Exposing a ref to your own component\nExample 1 of 4: Focusing a text input \n\nIn this example, clicking the button will focus the input:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input ref={inputRef} />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Focus the input\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nAvoiding recreating the ref contents \n\nReact saves the initial ref value once and ignores it on the next renders.\n\nfunction Video() {\n\n  const playerRef = useRef(new VideoPlayer());\n\n  // ...\n\nAlthough the result of new VideoPlayer() is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating expensive objects.\n\nTo solve it, you may initialize the ref like this instead:\n\nfunction Video() {\n\n  const playerRef = useRef(null);\n\n  if (playerRef.current === null) {\n\n    playerRef.current = new VideoPlayer();\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nNormally, writing or reading ref.current during render is not allowed. However, it’s fine in this case because the result is always the same, and the condition only executes during initialization so it’s fully predictable.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to avoid null checks when initializing useRef later \nShow Details\nTroubleshooting \nI can’t get a ref to a custom component \n\nIf you try to pass a ref to your own component like this:\n\nconst inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\nreturn <MyInput ref={inputRef} />;\n\nYou might get an error in the console:\n\nConsole\nWarning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?\n\nBy default, your own components don’t expose refs to the DOM nodes inside them.\n\nTo fix this, find the component that you want to get a ref to:\n\nexport default function MyInput({ value, onChange }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <input\n\n      value={value}\n\n      onChange={onChange}\n\n    />\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAnd then wrap it in forwardRef like this:\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(({ value, onChange }, ref) => {\n\n  return (\n\n    <input\n\n      value={value}\n\n      onChange={onChange}\n\n      ref={ref}\n\n    />\n\n  );\n\n});\n\n\n\nexport default MyInput;\n\nThen the parent component can get a ref to it.\n\nRead more about accessing another component’s DOM nodes.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseReducer\nNEXT\nuseState"

If you read the state variable after calling the dispatch function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.\n\nIf the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn’t affect your code.\n\nReact batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.\n\nUsage \nAdding a reducer to a component \n\nCall useReducer at the top level of your component to manage state with a reducer.\n\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });\n\n  // ...\n\nuseReducer returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.\nThe dispatch function that lets you change it in response to interaction.\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call dispatch with an object representing what the user did, called an action:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n}\n\nReact will pass the current state and the action to your reducer function.

By convention, it is common to write it as a switch statement. For each case in the switch, calculate and return some next state.\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      return {\n\n        name: state.name,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      return {\n\n        name: action.nextName,\n\n        age: state.age\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n}\n\nActions can have any shape. By convention, it’s common to pass objects with a type property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 });\n\n  \n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleInputChange(e) {\n\n    dispatch({\n\n      type: 'changed_name',\n\n      nextName: e.target.value\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThe action type names are local to your component.

This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.\n\nTo solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useReducer as the third argument instead:\n\nfunction createInitialState(username) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ username }) {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, username, createInitialState);\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice that you’re passing createInitialState, which is the function itself, and not createInitialState(), which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.\n\nIn the above example, createInitialState takes a username argument. If your initializer doesn’t need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass null as the second argument to useReducer.\n\nThe difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly\n1. Passing the initializer function\n2. Passing the initial state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the initializer function \n\nThis example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialState function only runs during initialization.

Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the state JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.\n\nIf you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself:\n\nconst action = { type: 'incremented_age' };\n\ndispatch(action);\n\n\n\nconst nextState = reducer(state, action);\n\nconsole.log(state);     // { age: 42 }\n\nconsole.log(nextState); // { age: 43 }\nI’ve dispatched an action, but the screen doesn’t update \n\nReact will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\n      state.age++;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\n      state.name = action.nextName;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nYou mutated an existing state object and returned it, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always updating objects in state and updating arrays in state instead of mutating them:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        name: action.nextName\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nA part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching \n\nMake sure that every case branch copies all of the existing fields when returning the new state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state, // Don't forget this!\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\nWithout ...state above, the returned next state would only contain the age field and nothing else.\n\nMy entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching \n\nIf your state unexpectedly becomes undefined, you’re likely forgetting to return state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn’t match any of the case statements. To find why, throw an error outside the switch:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ...\n\n    }\n\n    case 'edited_name': {\n\n      // ...\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n}\n\nYou can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.\n\nI’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” \n\nYou might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally dispatching an action during render, so your component enters a loop: render, dispatch (which causes a render), render, dispatch (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function\n\nreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n\nIf you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific dispatch function call responsible for the error.\n\nMy reducer or initializer function runs twice \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your reducer and initializer functions twice. This shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and reducer functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.\n\nFor example, this impure reducer function mutates an array in state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'added_todo': {\n\n      // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state\n\n      state.todos.push({ id: nextId++, text: action.text });\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nBecause React calls your reducer function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'added_todo': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        todos: [\n\n          ...state.todos,\n\n          { id: nextId++, text: action.text }\n\n        ]\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nNow that this reducer function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and reducer functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseOptimistic\nNEXT\nuseRef"

Learn more about React’s release channels here.\n\nuseOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you optimistically update the UI.\n\n  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(state, updateFn);\nReference\nuseOptimistic(state, updateFn)\nUsage\nOptimistically updating forms\nReference \nuseOptimistic(state, updateFn) \n\nuseOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you show a different state while an async action is underway. It accepts some state as an argument and returns a copy of that state that can be different during the duration of an async action such as a network request. You provide a function that takes the current state and the input to the action, and returns the optimistic state to be used while the action is pending.\n\nThis state is called the “optimistic” state because it is usually used to immediately present the user with the result of performing an action, even though the action actually takes time to complete.\n\nimport { useOptimistic } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction AppContainer() {\n\n  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(\n\n    state,\n\n    // updateFn\n\n    (currentState, optimisticValue) => {\n\n      // merge and return new state\n\n      // with optimistic value\n\n    }\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nstate: the value to be returned initially and whenever no action is pending.\nupdateFn(currentState, optimisticValue): a function that takes the current state and the optimistic value passed to addOptimistic and returns the resulting optimistic state. It must be a pure function. updateFn takes in two parameters. The currentState and the optimisticValue. The return value will be the merged value of the currentState and optimisticValue.\nReturns \noptimisticState: The resulting optimistic state. It is equal to state unless an action is pending, in which case it is equal to the value returned by updateFn.\naddOptimistic: addOptimistic is the dispatching function to call when you have an optimistic update. It takes one argument, optimisticValue, of any type and will call the updateFn with state and optimisticValue.\nUsage \nOptimistically updating forms \n\nThe useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.\n\nFor example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.\n\nApp.js\nactions.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useOptimistic, useState, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { deliverMessage } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction Thread({ messages, sendMessage }) {\n  const formRef = useRef();\n  async function formAction(formData) {\n    addOptimisticMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    formRef.current.reset();\n    await sendMessage(formData);\n  }\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(\n    messages,\n    (state, newMessage) => [\n      ...state,\n      {\n        text: newMessage,\n        sending: true\n      }\n    ]\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((message, index) => (\n        <div key={index}>\n          {message.text}\n          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      <form action={formAction} ref={formRef}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Hello!\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([\n    { text: \"Hello there!\", sending: false, key: 1 }\n  ]);\n  async function sendMessage(formData) {\n    const sentMessage = await deliverMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    setMessages((messages) => [...messages, { text: sentMessage }]);\n  }\n  return <Thread messages={messages} sendMessage={sendMessage} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nuseMemo\nNEXT\nuseReducer"

It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your function during the initial render. On next renders, React will return the same value again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will call calculateValue, return its result, and store it so it can be reused later.\n\ndependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the calculateValue code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison.\n\nReturns \n\nOn the initial render, useMemo returns the result of calling calculateValue with no arguments.\n\nDuring next renders, it will either return an already stored value from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or call calculateValue again, and return the result that calculateValue has returned.\n\nCaveats \nuseMemo is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your calculation function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your calculation function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\nReact will not throw away the cached value unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on useMemo solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.\nNote\n\nCaching return values like this is also known as memoization, which is why this Hook is called useMemo.\n\nUsage \nSkipping expensive recalculations \n\nTo cache a calculation between re-renders, wrap it in a useMemo call at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou need to pass two things to useMemo:\n\nA calculation function that takes no arguments, like () =>, and returns what you wanted to calculate.\nA list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your calculation.\n\nOn the initial render, the value you’ll get from useMemo will be the result of calling your calculation.\n\nOn every subsequent render, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the last render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useMemo will return the value you already calculated before. Otherwise, React will re-run your calculation and return the new value.\n\nIn other words, useMemo caches a calculation result between re-renders until its dependencies change.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nBy default, React will re-run the entire body of your component every time that it re-renders. For example, if this TodoList updates its state or receives new props from its parent, the filterTodos function will re-run:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nUsually, this isn’t a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you’re filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn’t changed. If both todos and tab are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in useMemo like earlier lets you reuse visibleTodos you’ve already calculated before.\n\nThis type of caching is called memoization.\n\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on useMemo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useMemo to improve performance.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to tell if a calculation is expensive? \nShow Details\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add useMemo everywhere? \nShow Details\nThe difference between useMemo and calculating a value directly\n1. Skipping recalculation with useMemo\n2. Always recalculating a value\nExample 1 of 2: Skipping recalculation with useMemo \n\nIn this example, the filterTodos implementation is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when some JavaScript function you’re calling during rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.\n\nSwitching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down filterTodos to re-execute. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so the entire calculation needs to re-run. (If you’re curious why it runs twice, it’s explained here.)\n\nToggle the theme. Thanks to useMemo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The slow filterTodos call was skipped because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nTodoList.js\nutils.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport { filterTodos } from './utils.js'\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, theme, tab }) {\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n    [todos, tab]\n  );\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <p><b>Note: <code>filterTodos</code> is artificially slowed down!</b></p>\n      <ul>\n        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (\n          <li key={todo.id}>\n            {todo.completed ?\n              <s>{todo.text}</s> :\n              todo.text\n            }\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nSkipping re-rendering of components \n\nIn some cases, useMemo can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components. To illustrate this, let’s say this TodoList component passes the visibleTodos as a prop to the child List component:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <List /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the List component.\n\nBy default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when TodoList re-renders with a different theme, the List component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you’ve verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell List to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst List = memo(function List({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWith this change, List will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated visibleTodos without useMemo:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different array...\n\n  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ... so List's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, the filterTodos function always creates a different array, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that List props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useMemo comes in handy:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // Tell React to cache your calculation between re-renders...\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n\n    [todos, tab] // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...\n\n  );\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ...List will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBy wrapping the visibleTodos calculation in useMemo, you ensure that it has the same value between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a calculation in useMemo unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are a few other reasons to add useMemo which are described further on this page.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nMemoizing individual JSX nodes \nShow Details\nThe difference between skipping re-renders and always re-rendering\n1. Skipping re-rendering with useMemo and memo\n2. Always re-rendering a component\nExample 1 of 2: Skipping re-rendering with useMemo and memo \n\nIn this example, the List component is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.\n\nSwitching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down List to re-render. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.\n\nNext, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useMemo together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The List skipped re-rendering because the visibleTodos array has not changed since the last render. The visibleTodos array has not changed because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nTodoList.js\nList.js\nutils.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport List from './List.js';\nimport { filterTodos } from './utils.js'\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, theme, tab }) {\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n    [todos, tab]\n  );\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <p><b>Note: <code>List</code> is artificially slowed down!</b></p>\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nMemoizing a dependency of another Hook \n\nSuppose you have a calculation that depends on an object created directly in the component body:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // 🚩 Caution: Dependency on an object created in the component body\n\n  // ...\n\nDepending on an object like this defeats the point of memoization. When a component re-renders, all of the code directly inside the component body runs again. The lines of code creating the searchOptions object will also run on every re-render. Since searchOptions is a dependency of your useMemo call, and it’s different every time, React knows the dependencies are different, and recalculate searchItems every time.\n\nTo fix this, you could memoize the searchOptions object itself before passing it as a dependency:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n  }, [text]); // ✅ Only changes when text changes\n\n\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or searchOptions changes\n\n  // ...\n\nIn the example above, if the text did not change, the searchOptions object also won’t change. However, an even better fix is to move the searchOptions object declaration inside of the useMemo calculation function:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, text]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or text changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your calculation depends on text directly (which is a string and can’t “accidentally” become different).\n\nMemoizing a function \n\nSuppose the Form component is wrapped in memo. You want to pass a function to it as a prop:\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nJust as {} creates a different object, function declarations like function() {} and expressions like () => {} produce a different function on every re-render. By itself, creating a new function is not a problem. This is not something to avoid! However, if the Form component is memoized, presumably you want to skip re-rendering it when no props have changed. A prop that is always different would defeat the point of memoization.\n\nTo memoize a function with useMemo, your calculation function would have to return another function:\n\nexport default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return (orderDetails) => {\n\n      post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n        referrer,\n\n        orderDetails\n\n      });\n\n    };\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nThis looks clunky! Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into useCallback instead of useMemo to avoid having to write an extra nested function:\n\nexport default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nThe two examples above are completely equivalent. The only benefit to useCallback is that it lets you avoid writing an extra nested function inside. It doesn’t do anything else. Read more about useCallback.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy calculation runs twice on every re-render \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // This component function will run twice for every render.\n\n\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    // This calculation will run twice if any of the dependencies change.\n\n    return filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is expected and shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake.\n\nFor example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    // 🚩 Mistake: mutating a prop\n\n    todos.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });\n\n    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n    return filtered;\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\nReact calls your function twice, so you’d notice the todo is added twice. Your calculation shouldn’t change any existing objects, but it’s okay to change any new objects you created during the calculation. For example, if the filterTodos function always returns a different array, you can mutate that array instead:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n    // ✅ Correct: mutating an object you created during the calculation\n\n    filtered.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });\n\n    return filtered;\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more about purity.\n\nAlso, check out the guides on updating objects and updating arrays without mutation.\n\nMy useMemo call is supposed to return an object, but returns undefined \n\nThis code doesn’t work:\n\n  // 🔴 You can't return an object from an arrow function with () => {\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n    text: text\n\n  }, [text]);\n\nIn JavaScript, () => { starts the arrow function body, so the { brace is not a part of your object. This is why it doesn’t return an object, and leads to mistakes. You could fix it by adding parentheses like ({ and }):\n\n  // This works, but is easy for someone to break again\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => ({\n\n    matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n    text: text\n\n  }), [text]);\n\nHowever, this is still confusing and too easy for someone to break by removing the parentheses.\n\nTo avoid this mistake, write a return statement explicitly:\n\n  // ✅ This works and is explicit\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n      text: text\n\n    };\n\n  }, [text]);\nEvery time my component renders, the calculation in useMemo re-runs \n\nMake sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!\n\nIf you forget the dependency array, useMemo will re-run the calculation every time:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // 🔴 Recalculates every time: no dependency array\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab));\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // ✅ Does not recalculate unnecessarily\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\nIf this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  console.log([todos, tab]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find which dependency breaks memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.\n\nI need to call useMemo for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed \n\nSuppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useMemo in a loop:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item => {\n\n        // 🔴 You can't call useMemo in a loop like this:\n\n        const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);\n\n        return (\n\n          <figure key={item.id}>\n\n            <Chart data={data} />\n\n          </figure>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nInstead, extract a component for each item and memoize data for individual items:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item =>\n\n        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Report({ item }) {\n\n  // ✅ Call useMemo at the top level:\n\n  const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart data={data} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, you could remove useMemo and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {\n\n  const data = calculateReport(item);\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart data={data} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\nuseLayoutEffect\nNEXT\nuseOptimistic"

Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. Before your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. Before your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.\n\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the setup code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.\n\nReturns \n\nuseLayoutEffect returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nuseLayoutEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a component and move the Effect there.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.\n\nIf some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect.\n\nEffects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.\n\nThe code inside useLayoutEffect and all state updates scheduled from it block the browser from repainting the screen. When used excessively, this makes your app slow. When possible, prefer useEffect.\n\nUsage \nMeasuring layout before the browser repaints the screen \n\nMost components don’t need to know their position and size on the screen to decide what to render. They only return some JSX. Then the browser calculates their layout (position and size) and repaints the screen.\n\nSometimes, that’s not enough. Imagine a tooltip that appears next to some element on hover. If there’s enough space, the tooltip should appear above the element, but if it doesn’t fit, it should appear below. In order to render the tooltip at the right final position, you need to know its height (i.e. whether it fits at the top).\n\nTo do this, you need to render in two passes:\n\nRender the tooltip anywhere (even with a wrong position).\nMeasure its height and decide where to place the tooltip.\nRender the tooltip again in the correct place.\n\nAll of this needs to happen before the browser repaints the screen. You don’t want the user to see the tooltip moving. Call useLayoutEffect to perform the layout measurements before the browser repaints the screen:\n\nfunction Tooltip() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0); // You don't know real height yet\n\n\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n\n    setTooltipHeight(height); // Re-render now that you know the real height\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  // ...use tooltipHeight in the rendering logic below...\n\n}\n\nHere’s how this works step by step:\n\nTooltip renders with the initial tooltipHeight = 0 (so the tooltip may be wrongly positioned).\nReact places it in the DOM and runs the code in useLayoutEffect.\nYour useLayoutEffect measures the height of the tooltip content and triggers an immediate re-render.\nTooltip renders again with the real tooltipHeight (so the tooltip is correctly positioned).\nReact updates it in the DOM, and the browser finally displays the tooltip.\n\nHover over the buttons below and see how the tooltip adjusts its position depending on whether it fits:\n\nTooltip.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport TooltipContainer from './TooltipContainer.js';\n\nexport default function Tooltip({ children, targetRect }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n    setTooltipHeight(height);\n    console.log('Measured tooltip height: ' + height);\n  }, []);\n\n  let tooltipX = 0;\n  let tooltipY = 0;\n  if (targetRect !== null) {\n    tooltipX = targetRect.left;\n    tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight;\n    if (tooltipY < 0) {\n      // It doesn't fit above, so place below.\n      tooltipY = targetRect.bottom;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return createPortal(\n    <TooltipContainer x={tooltipX} y={tooltipY} contentRef={ref}>\n      {children}\n    </TooltipContainer>,\n    document.body\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that even though the Tooltip component has to render in two passes (first, with tooltipHeight initialized to 0 and then with the real measured height), you only see the final result. This is why you need useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect for this example. Let’s look at the difference in detail below.\n\nuseLayoutEffect vs useEffect\n1. useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from repainting\n2. useEffect does not block the browser\nExample 1 of 2: useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from repainting \n\nReact guarantees that the code inside useLayoutEffect and any state updates scheduled inside it will be processed before the browser repaints the screen. This lets you render the tooltip, measure it, and re-render the tooltip again without the user noticing the first extra render. In other words, useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from painting.\n\nTooltip.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport TooltipContainer from './TooltipContainer.js';\n\nexport default function Tooltip({ children, targetRect }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n    setTooltipHeight(height);\n  }, []);\n\n  let tooltipX = 0;\n  let tooltipY = 0;\n  if (targetRect !== null) {\n    tooltipX = targetRect.left;\n    tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight;\n    if (tooltipY < 0) {\n      // It doesn't fit above, so place below.\n      tooltipY = targetRect.bottom;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return createPortal(\n    <TooltipContainer x={tooltipX} y={tooltipY} contentRef={ref}>\n      {children}\n    </TooltipContainer>,\n    document.body\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nNote\n\nRendering in two passes and blocking the browser hurts performance. Try to avoid this when you can.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: ”useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server” \n\nThe purpose of useLayoutEffect is to let your component use layout information for rendering:\n\nRender the initial content.\nMeasure the layout before the browser repaints the screen.\nRender the final content using the layout information you’ve read.\n\nWhen you or your framework uses server rendering, your React app renders to HTML on the server for the initial render. This lets you show the initial HTML before the JavaScript code loads.\n\nThe problem is that on the server, there is no layout information.\n\nIn the earlier example, the useLayoutEffect call in the Tooltip component lets it position itself correctly (either above or below content) depending on the content height. If you tried to render Tooltip as a part of the initial server HTML, this would be impossible to determine. On the server, there is no layout yet! So, even if you rendered it on the server, its position would “jump” on the client after the JavaScript loads and runs.\n\nUsually, components that rely on layout information don’t need to render on the server anyway. For example, it probably doesn’t make sense to show a Tooltip during the initial render. It is triggered by a client interaction.\n\nHowever, if you’re running into this problem, you have a few different options:\n\nReplace useLayoutEffect with useEffect. This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs).\n\nAlternatively, mark your component as client-only. This tells React to replace its content up to the closest <Suspense> boundary with a loading fallback (for example, a spinner or a glimmer) during server rendering.\n\nAlternatively, you can render a component with useLayoutEffect only after hydration. Keep a boolean isMounted state that’s initialized to false, and set it to true inside a useEffect call. Your rendering logic can then be like return isMounted ? <RealContent /> : <FallbackContent />. On the server and during the hydration, the user will see FallbackContent which should not call useLayoutEffect. Then React will replace it with RealContent which runs on the client only and can include useLayoutEffect calls.\n\nIf you synchronize your component with an external data store and rely on useLayoutEffect for different reasons than measuring layout, consider useSyncExternalStore instead which supports server rendering.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseInsertionEffect\nNEXT\nuseMemo"

For example, if you want the parent component of MyInput to have access to the <input> DOM node, you have to opt in with forwardRef:\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={ref} />;\n\n});\n\nWith the code above, a ref to MyInput will receive the <input> DOM node. However, you can expose a custom value instead. To customize the exposed handle, call useImperativeHandle at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      // ... your methods ...\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} />;\n\n});\n\nNote that in the code above, the ref is no longer forwarded to the <input>.\n\nFor example, suppose you don’t want to expose the entire <input> DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: focus and scrollIntoView. To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use useImperativeHandle to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call:\n\nimport { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      focus() {\n\n        inputRef.current.focus();\n\n      },\n\n      scrollIntoView() {\n\n        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();\n\n      },\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;\n\n});\n\nNow, if the parent component gets a ref to MyInput, it will be able to call the focus and scrollIntoView methods on it. However, it will not have full access to the underlying <input> DOM node.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:\n    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput placeholder=\"Enter your name\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExposing your own imperative methods \n\nThe methods you expose via an imperative handle don’t have to match the DOM methods exactly. For example, this Post component exposes a scrollAndFocusAddComment method via an imperative handle. This lets the parent Page scroll the list of comments and focus the input field when you click the button:\n\nApp.js\nPost.js\nCommentList.js\nAddComment.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport Post from './Post.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const postRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    postRef.current.scrollAndFocusAddComment();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Write a comment\n      </button>\n      <Post ref={postRef} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nDo not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.\n\nIf you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseId\nNEXT\nuseInsertionEffect"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nHOOKS\nuseInsertionEffect\nPitfall\n\nuseInsertionEffect is for CSS-in-JS library authors. Unless you are working on a CSS-in-JS library and need a place to inject the styles, you probably want useEffect or useLayoutEffect instead.\n\nuseInsertionEffect allows inserting elements into the DOM before any layout effects fire.\n\nuseInsertionEffect(setup, dependencies?)\nReference\nuseInsertionEffect(setup, dependencies?)\nUsage\nInjecting dynamic styles from CSS-in-JS libraries\nReference \nuseInsertionEffect(setup, dependencies?) \n\nCall useInsertionEffect to insert styles before any effects fire that may need to read layout:\n\nimport { useInsertionEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// Inside your CSS-in-JS library\n\nfunction useCSS(rule) {\n\n  useInsertionEffect(() => {\n\n    // ... inject <style> tags here ...\n\n  });\n\n  return rule;\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nsetup: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, but before any layout effects fire, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. When your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.\n\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the setup code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm. If you don’t specify the dependencies at all, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.\n\nReturns \n\nuseInsertionEffect returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \nEffects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.\nYou can’t update state from inside useInsertionEffect.\nBy the time useInsertionEffect runs, refs are not attached yet.\nuseInsertionEffect may run either before or after the DOM has been updated. You shouldn’t rely on the DOM being updated at any particular time.\nUnlike other types of Effects, which fire cleanup for every Effect and then setup for every Effect, useInsertionEffect will fire both cleanup and setup one component at a time. This results in an “interleaving” of the cleanup and setup functions.\nUsage \nInjecting dynamic styles from CSS-in-JS libraries \n\nTraditionally, you would style React components using plain CSS.\n\n// In your JS file:\n\n<button className=\"success\" />\n\n\n\n// In your CSS file:\n\n.success { color: green; }\n\nSome teams prefer to author styles directly in JavaScript code instead of writing CSS files. This usually requires using a CSS-in-JS library or a tool. There are three common approaches to CSS-in-JS:\n\nStatic extraction to CSS files with a compiler\nInline styles, e.g. <div style={{ opacity: 1 }}>\nRuntime injection of <style> tags\n\nIf you use CSS-in-JS, we recommend a combination of the first two approaches (CSS files for static styles, inline styles for dynamic styles). We don’t recommend runtime <style> tag injection for two reasons:\n\nRuntime injection forces the browser to recalculate the styles a lot more often.\nRuntime injection can be very slow if it happens at the wrong time in the React lifecycle.\n\nThe first problem is not solvable, but useInsertionEffect helps you solve the second problem.\n\nCall useInsertionEffect to insert the styles before any layout effects fire:\n\n// Inside your CSS-in-JS library\n\nlet isInserted = new Set();\n\nfunction useCSS(rule) {\n\n  useInsertionEffect(() => {\n\n    // As explained earlier, we don't recommend runtime injection of <style> tags.\n\n    // But if you have to do it, then it's important to do in useInsertionEffect.\n\n    if (!isInserted.has(rule)) {\n\n      isInserted.add(rule);\n\n      document.head.appendChild(getStyleForRule(rule));\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n  return rule;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const className = useCSS('...');\n\n  return <div className={className} />;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly to useEffect, useInsertionEffect does not run on the server. If you need to collect which CSS rules have been used on the server, you can do it during rendering:\n\nlet collectedRulesSet = new Set();\n\n\n\nfunction useCSS(rule) {\n\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n\n    collectedRulesSet.add(rule);\n\n  }\n\n  useInsertionEffect(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  });\n\n  return rule;\n\n}\n\nRead more about upgrading CSS-in-JS libraries with runtime injection to useInsertionEffect.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is this better than injecting styles during rendering or useLayoutEffect? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nuseImperativeHandle\nNEXT\nuseLayoutEffect"

For example, you can specify that an element (like an input) is described by another element (like a paragraph).\n\nIn regular HTML, you would write it like this:\n\n<label>\n\n  Password:\n\n  <input\n\n    type=\"password\"\n\n    aria-describedby=\"password-hint\"\n\n  />\n\n</label>\n\n<p id=\"password-hint\">\n\n  The password should contain at least 18 characters\n\n</p>\n\nHowever, hardcoding IDs like this is not a good practice in React. A component may be rendered more than once on the page—but IDs have to be unique! Instead of hardcoding an ID, generate a unique ID with useId:\n\nimport { useId } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction PasswordField() {\n\n  const passwordHintId = useId();\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Password:\n\n        <input\n\n          type=\"password\"\n\n          aria-describedby={passwordHintId}\n\n        />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <p id={passwordHintId}>\n\n        The password should contain at least 18 characters\n\n      </p>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow, even if PasswordField appears multiple times on the screen, the generated IDs won’t clash.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { useId } from 'react';\n\nfunction PasswordField() {\n  const passwordHintId = useId();\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Password:\n        <input\n          type=\"password\"\n          aria-describedby={passwordHintId}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <p id={passwordHintId}>\n        The password should contain at least 18 characters\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Choose password</h2>\n      <PasswordField />\n      <h2>Confirm password</h2>\n      <PasswordField />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWatch this video to see the difference in the user experience with assistive technologies.\n\nPitfall\n\nWith server rendering, useId requires an identical component tree on the server and the client.

If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component. See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all.\n\nReturns \n\nuseEffect returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nuseEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\n\nIf you’re not trying to synchronize with some external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.\n\nIf some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect.\n\nIf your Effect wasn’t caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser paint the updated screen first before running your Effect. If your Effect is doing something visual (for example, positioning a tooltip), and the delay is noticeable (for example, it flickers), replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect.\n\nEven if your Effect was caused by an interaction (like a click), the browser may repaint the screen before processing the state updates inside your Effect. Usually, that’s what you want. However, if you must block the browser from repainting the screen, you need to replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect.\n\nEffects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.\n\nUsage \nConnecting to an external system \n\nSome components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external.\n\nTo connect your component to some external system, call useEffect at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n  \tconst connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n  \treturn () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n  \t};\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou need to pass two arguments to useEffect:\n\nA setup function with setup code that connects to that system.\nIt should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.\nA list of dependencies including every value from your component used inside of those functions.\n\nReact calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it’s necessary, which may happen multiple times:\n\nYour setup code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts).\nAfter every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:\nFirst, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.\nThen, your setup code runs with the new props and state.\nYour cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts).\n\nLet’s illustrate this sequence for the example above.\n\nWhen the ChatRoom component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial serverUrl and roomId. If either serverUrl or roomId change as a result of a re-render (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one. When the ChatRoom component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time.\n\nTo help you find bugs, in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the setup. This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development). See common solutions.\n\nTry to write every Effect as an independent process and think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly “mirrors” the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.\n\nNote\n\nAn Effect lets you keep your component synchronized with some external system (like a chat service). Here, external system means any piece of code that’s not controlled by React, such as:\n\nA timer managed with setInterval() and clearInterval().\nAn event subscription using window.addEventListener() and window.removeEventListener().\nA third-party animation library with an API like animation.start() and animation.reset().\n\nIf you’re not connecting to any external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.\n\nExamples of connecting to an external system\n1. Connecting to a chat server\n2. Listening to a global browser event\n3. Triggering an animation\n4. Controlling a modal dialog\n5. Tracking element visibility\nExample 1 of 5: Connecting to a chat server \n\nIn this example, the ChatRoom component uses an Effect to stay connected to an external system defined in chat.js. Press “Open chat” to make the ChatRoom component appear. This sandbox runs in development mode, so there is an extra connect-and-disconnect cycle, as explained here. Try changing the roomId and serverUrl using the dropdown and the input, and see how the Effect re-connects to the chat. Press “Close chat” to see the Effect disconnect one last time.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ?

If you find yourself often needing to manually write Effects, it’s usually a sign that you need to extract some custom Hooks for common behaviors your components rely on.\n\nFor example, this useChatRoom custom Hook “hides” the logic of your Effect behind a more declarative API:\n\nfunction useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n}\n\nThen you can use it from any component like this:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useChatRoom({\n\n    roomId: roomId,\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\nThere are also many excellent custom Hooks for every purpose available in the React ecosystem.\n\nLearn more about wrapping Effects in custom Hooks.\n\nExamples of wrapping Effects in custom Hooks\n1. Custom useChatRoom Hook\n2. Custom useWindowListener Hook\n3.

'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nControlling a non-React widget \n\nSometimes, you want to keep an external system synchronized to some prop or state of your component.\n\nFor example, if you have a third-party map widget or a video player component written without React, you can use an Effect to call methods on it that make its state match the current state of your React component. This Effect creates an instance of a MapWidget class defined in map-widget.js. When you change the zoomLevel prop of the Map component, the Effect calls the setZoom() on the class instance to keep it synchronized:\n\nMap.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { MapWidget } from './map-widget.js';\n\nexport default function Map({ zoomLevel }) {\n  const containerRef = useRef(null);\n  const mapRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (mapRef.current === null) {\n      mapRef.current = new MapWidget(containerRef.current);\n    }\n\n    const map = mapRef.current;\n    map.setZoom(zoomLevel);\n  }, [zoomLevel]);\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}\n      ref={containerRef}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn this example, a cleanup function is not needed because the MapWidget class manages only the DOM node that was passed to it. After the Map React component is removed from the tree, both the DOM node and the MapWidget class instance will be automatically garbage-collected by the browser JavaScript engine.\n\nFetching data with Effects \n\nYou can use an Effect to fetch data for your component. Note that if you use a framework, using your framework’s data fetching mechanism will be a lot more efficient than writing Effects manually.\n\nIf you want to fetch data from an Effect manually, your code might look like this:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function Page() {\n\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    setBio(null);\n\n    fetchBio(person).then(result => {\n\n      if (!ignore) {\n\n        setBio(result);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [person]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nNote the ignore variable which is initialized to false, and is set to true during cleanup. This ensures your code doesn’t suffer from “race conditions”: network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let ignore = false;\n    setBio(null);\n    fetchBio(person).then(result => {\n      if (!ignore) {\n        setBio(result);\n      }\n    });\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    }\n  }, [person]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <select value={person} onChange={e => {\n        setPerson(e.target.value);\n      }}>\n        <option value=\"Alice\">Alice</option>\n        <option value=\"Bob\">Bob</option>\n        <option value=\"Taylor\">Taylor</option>\n      </select>\n      <hr />\n      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can also rewrite using the async / await syntax, but you still need to provide a cleanup function:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function startFetching() {\n      setBio(null);\n      const result = await fetchBio(person);\n      if (!ignore) {\n        setBio(result);\n      }\n    }\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    startFetching();\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    }\n  }, [person]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <select value={person} onChange={e => {\n        setPerson(e.target.value);\n      }}>\n        <option value=\"Alice\">Alice</option>\n        <option value=\"Bob\">Bob</option>\n        <option value=\"Taylor\">Taylor</option>\n      </select>\n      <hr />\n      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWriting data fetching directly in Effects gets repetitive and makes it difficult to add optimizations like caching and server rendering later. It’s easier to use a custom Hook—either your own or maintained by the community.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhat are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? \nShow Details\nSpecifying reactive dependencies \n\nNotice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect’s dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // This is a reactive value too\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads these reactive values\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify them as dependencies of your Effect\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf either serverUrl or roomId change, your Effect will reconnect to the chat using the new values.\n\nReactive values include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since roomId and serverUrl are reactive values, you can’t remove them from the dependencies. If you try to omit them and your linter is correctly configured for React, the linter will flag this as a mistake you need to fix:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  \n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'roomId' and 'serverUrl'\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTo remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it doesn’t need to be a dependency. For example, you can move serverUrl out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow that serverUrl is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency. If your Effect’s code doesn’t use any reactive values, its dependency list should be empty ([]):\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\nconst roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nAn Effect with empty dependencies doesn’t re-run when any of your component’s props or state change.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:\n\n  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n\n}, []);\n\nWhen dependencies don’t match the code, there is a high risk of introducing bugs. By suppressing the linter, you “lie” to React about the values your Effect depends on. Instead, prove they’re unnecessary.\n\nExamples of passing reactive dependencies\n1. Passing a dependency array\n2. Passing an empty dependency array\n3. Passing no dependency array at all\nExample 1 of 3: Passing a dependency array \n\nIf you specify the dependencies, your Effect runs after the initial render and after re-renders with changed dependencies.\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n}, [a, b]); // Runs again if a or b are different\n\nIn the below example, serverUrl and roomId are reactive values, so they both must be specified as dependencies. As a result, selecting a different room in the dropdown or editing the server URL input causes the chat to re-connect. However, since message isn’t used in the Effect (and so it isn’t a dependency), editing the message doesn’t re-connect to the chat.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <label>\n        Your message:{' '}\n        <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n        <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n          {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n        </button>\n      </label>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId}/>}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating state based on previous state from an Effect \n\nWhen you want to update state based on previous state from an Effect, you might run into a problem:\n\nfunction Counter() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n\n      setCount(count + 1); // You want to increment the counter every second...\n\n    }, 1000)\n\n    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);\n\n  }, [count]); // 🚩 ... but specifying `count` as a dependency always resets the interval.\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSince count is a reactive value, it must be specified in the list of dependencies. However, that causes the Effect to cleanup and setup again every time the count changes. This is not ideal.\n\nTo fix this, pass the c => c + 1 state updater to setCount:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n      setCount(c => c + 1); // ✅ Pass a state updater\n    }, 1000);\n    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);\n  }, []); // ✅ Now count is not a dependency\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nNow that you’re passing c => c + 1 instead of count + 1, your Effect no longer needs to depend on count. As a result of this fix, it won’t need to cleanup and setup the interval again every time the count changes.\n\nRemoving unnecessary object dependencies \n\nIf your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the options object is different for every render:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const options = { // 🚩 This object is created from scratch on every re-render\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n    roomId: roomId\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options); // It's used inside the Effect\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render\n\n  // ...\n\nAvoid using an object created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, create the object inside the Effect:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const options = {\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n      roomId: roomId\n    };\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNow that you create the options object inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the roomId string.\n\nWith this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike an object which gets re-created, a string like roomId doesn’t change unless you set it to another value.

For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the createOptions function is different for every render:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  function createOptions() { // 🚩 This function is created from scratch on every re-render\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions(); // It's used inside the Effect\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render\n\n  // ...\n\nBy itself, creating a function from scratch on every re-render is not a problem. You don’t need to optimize that. However, if you use it as a dependency of your Effect, it will cause your Effect to re-run after every re-render.\n\nAvoid using a function created during rendering as a dependency.

Read more about removing dependencies.\n\nReading the latest props and state from an Effect \nUnder Construction\n\nThis section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.\n\nBy default, when you read a reactive value from an Effect, you have to add it as a dependency. This ensures that your Effect “reacts” to every change of that value. For most dependencies, that’s the behavior you want.\n\nHowever, sometimes you’ll want to read the latest props and state from an Effect without “reacting” to them. For example, imagine you want to log the number of the items in the shopping cart for every page visit:\n\nfunction Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(url, shoppingCart.length);\n\n  }, [url, shoppingCart]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhat if you want to log a new page visit after every url change, but not if only the shoppingCart changes? You can’t exclude shoppingCart from dependencies without breaking the reactivity rules. However, you can express that you don’t want a piece of code to “react” to changes even though it is called from inside an Effect. Declare an Effect Event with the useEffectEvent Hook, and move the code reading shoppingCart inside of it:\n\nfunction Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, shoppingCart.length)\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onVisit(url);\n\n  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nEffect Events are not reactive and must always be omitted from dependencies of your Effect. This is what lets you put non-reactive code (where you can read the latest value of some props and state) inside of them. By reading shoppingCart inside of onVisit, you ensure that shoppingCart won’t re-run your Effect.\n\nRead more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code.\n\nDisplaying different content on the server and the client \n\nIf your app uses server rendering (either directly or via a framework), your component will render in two different environments. On the server, it will render to produce the initial HTML. On the client, React will run the rendering code again so that it can attach your event handlers to that HTML. This is why, for hydration to work, your initial render output must be identical on the client and the server.\n\nIn rare cases, you might need to display different content on the client. For example, if your app reads some data from localStorage, it can’t possibly do that on the server. Here is how you could implement this:\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [didMount, setDidMount] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setDidMount(true);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  if (didMount) {\n\n    // ... return client-only JSX ...\n\n  }  else {\n\n    // ... return initial JSX ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nWhile the app is loading, the user will see the initial render output. Then, when it’s loaded and hydrated, your Effect will run and set didMount to true, triggering a re-render. This will switch to the client-only render output. Effects don’t run on the server, so this is why didMount was false during the initial server render.\n\nUse this pattern sparingly. Keep in mind that users with a slow connection will see the initial content for quite a bit of time—potentially, many seconds—so you don’t want to make jarring changes to your component’s appearance. In many cases, you can avoid the need for this by conditionally showing different things with CSS.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy Effect runs twice when the component mounts \n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development, React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup.\n\nThis is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development).\n\nRead more about how this helps find bugs and how to fix your logic.\n\nMy Effect runs after every re-render \n\nFirst, check that you haven’t forgotten to specify the dependency array:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n}); // 🚩 No dependency array: re-runs after every render!\n\nIf you’ve specified the dependency array but your Effect still re-runs in a loop, it’s because one of your dependencies is different on every re-render.\n\nYou can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ..\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n\n\n  console.log([serverUrl, roomId]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find the dependency that is different on every re-render, you can usually fix it in one of these ways:\n\nUpdating state based on previous state from an Effect\nRemoving unnecessary object dependencies\nRemoving unnecessary function dependencies\nReading the latest props and state from an Effect\n\nAs a last resort (if these methods didn’t help), wrap its creation with useMemo or useCallback (for functions).\n\nMy Effect keeps re-running in an infinite cycle \n\nIf your Effect runs in an infinite cycle, these two things must be true:\n\nYour Effect is updating some state.\nThat state leads to a re-render, which causes the Effect’s dependencies to change.\n\nBefore you start fixing the problem, ask yourself whether your Effect is connecting to some external system (like DOM, network, a third-party widget, and so on). Why does your Effect need to set state? Does it synchronize with that external system? Or are you trying to manage your application’s data flow with it?\n\nIf there is no external system, consider whether removing the Effect altogether would simplify your logic.\n\nIf you’re genuinely synchronizing with some external system, think about why and under what conditions your Effect should update the state. Has something changed that affects your component’s visual output? If you need to keep track of some data that isn’t used by rendering, a ref (which doesn’t trigger re-renders) might be more appropriate. Verify your Effect doesn’t update the state (and trigger re-renders) more than needed.\n\nFinally, if your Effect is updating the state at the right time, but there is still a loop, it’s because that state update leads to one of the Effect’s dependencies changing. Read how to debug dependency changes.\n\nMy cleanup logic runs even though my component didn’t unmount \n\nThe cleanup function runs not only during unmount, but before every re-render with changed dependencies. Additionally, in development, React runs setup+cleanup one extra time immediately after component mounts.\n\nIf you have cleanup code without corresponding setup code, it’s usually a code smell:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Cleanup logic without corresponding setup logic\n\n  return () => {\n\n    doSomething();\n\n  };\n\n}, []);\n\nYour cleanup logic should be “symmetrical” to the setup logic, and should stop or undo whatever setup did:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\nLearn how the Effect lifecycle is different from the component’s lifecycle.\n\nMy Effect does something visual, and I see a flicker before it runs \n\nIf your Effect must block the browser from painting the screen, replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect. Note that this shouldn’t be needed for the vast majority of Effects. You’ll only need this if it’s crucial to run your Effect before the browser paint: for example, to measure and position a tooltip before the user sees it.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseDeferredValue\nNEXT\nuseId"

It can have any type.\nReturns \n\nDuring the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so it will return the old value), and then try another re-render in background with the new value (so it will return the updated value).\n\nCaveats \n\nThe values you pass to useDeferredValue should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.\n\nWhen useDeferredValue receives a different value (compared with Object.is), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the value, React will restart the background re-render from scratch. For example, if the user is typing into an input faster than a chart receiving its deferred value can re-render, the chart will only re-render after the user stops typing.\n\nuseDeferredValue is integrated with <Suspense>. If the background update caused by a new value suspends the UI, the user will not see the fallback. They will see the old deferred value until the data loads.\n\nuseDeferredValue does not by itself prevent extra network requests.\n\nThere is no fixed delay caused by useDeferredValue itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value. Any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it.\n\nThe background re-render caused by useDeferredValue does not fire Effects until it’s committed to the screen. If the background re-render suspends, its Effects will run after the data loads and the UI updates.\n\nUsage \nShowing stale content while fresh content is loading \n\nCall useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI.\n\nimport { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction SearchPage() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nDuring the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided.\n\nDuring updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value. In particular, React will first re-render without updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in background.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nNote\n\nThis example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nLearn more about Suspense and its limitations.\n\nIn this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Try typing \"a\", waiting for the results, and then editing it to \"ab\". The results for \"a\" get replaced by the loading fallback.\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={query} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call useDeferredValue to pass a deferred version of the query down:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Search albums:\n\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.\n\nEnter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nHow does deferring a value work under the hood? \nShow Details\nIndicating that the content is stale \n\nIn the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:\n\n<div style={{\n\n  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1,\n\n}}>\n\n  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n</div>\n\nWith this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below:\n\nApp.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <div style={{\n          opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1,\n          transition: isStale ? 'opacity 0.2s 0.2s linear' : 'opacity 0s 0s linear'\n        }}>\n          <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n        </div>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDeferring re-rendering for a part of the UI \n\nYou can also apply useDeferredValue as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI.\n\nImagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <SlowList text={text} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nFirst, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this, wrap it in memo:\n\nconst SlowList = memo(function SlowList({ text }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nHowever, this only helps if the SlowList props are the same as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re different, and when you actually need to show different visual output.\n\nConcretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the SlowList receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, useDeferredValue lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower):\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <SlowList text={deferredText} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis does not make re-rendering of the SlowList faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing.\n\nThe difference between useDeferredValue and unoptimized re-rendering\n1. Deferred re-rendering of the list\n2. Unoptimized re-rendering of the list\nExample 1 of 2: Deferred re-rendering of the list \n\nIn this example, each item in the SlowList component is artificially slowed down so that you can see how useDeferredValue lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it.\n\nApp.js\nSlowList.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SlowList from './SlowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <SlowList text={deferredText} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNext Example\nPitfall\n\nThis optimization requires SlowList to be wrapped in memo. This is because whenever the text changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, deferredText still has its previous value, so SlowList is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without memo, it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is deferring a value different from debouncing and throttling? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nuseDebugValue\nNEXT\nuseEffect"

The corresponding <Context.Provider> needs to be above the component doing the useContext() call.\nReact automatically re-renders all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different value. The previous and the next values are compared with the Object.is comparison. Skipping re-renders with memo does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.\nIf your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context.

Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings.\n\nNext Example\nSpecifying a fallback default value \n\nIf React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by useContext() will be equal to the default value that you specified when you created that context:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nThe default value never changes. If you want to update context, use it with state as described above.\n\nOften, instead of null, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nThis way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.\n\nIn the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s outside any theme context provider and the default context theme value is 'light'. Try editing the default theme to be 'dark'.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReset\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>\n        <Form />\n      </ThemeContext.Provider>\n      <Button onClick={() => {\n        setTheme(theme === 'dark' ?

Whenever MyApp re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a different object pointing at a different function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call useContext(AuthContext).\n\nIn smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like currentUser, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the login function with useCallback and wrap the object creation into useMemo. This is a performance optimization:\n\nimport { useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyApp() {\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  const login = useCallback((response) => {\n\n    storeCredentials(response.credentials);\n\n    setCurrentUser(response.user);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({\n\n    currentUser,\n\n    login\n\n  }), [currentUser, login]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <AuthContext.Provider value={contextValue}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </AuthContext.Provider>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAs a result of this change, even if MyApp needs to re-render, the components calling useContext(AuthContext) won’t need to re-render unless currentUser has changed.\n\nRead more about useMemo and useCallback.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component doesn’t see the value from my provider \n\nThere are a few common ways that this can happen:\n\nYou’re rendering <SomeContext.Provider> in the same component (or below) as where you’re calling useContext(). Move <SomeContext.Provider> above and outside the component calling useContext().\nYou may have forgotten to wrap your component with <SomeContext.Provider>, or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using React DevTools.\nYou might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes SomeContext as seen from the providing component and SomeContext as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like window.SomeContext1 and window.SomeContext2 and then checking whether window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2 in the console. If they’re not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level.\nI am always getting undefined from my context although the default value is different \n\nYou might have a provider without a value in the tree:\n\n// 🚩 Doesn't work: no value prop\n\n<ThemeContext.Provider>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext.Provider>\n\nIf you forget to specify value, it’s like passing value={undefined}.\n\nYou may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:\n\n// 🚩 Doesn't work: prop should be called \"value\"\n\n<ThemeContext.Provider theme={theme}>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext.Provider>\n\nIn both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop value:\n\n// ✅ Passing the value prop\n\n<ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext.Provider>\n\nNote that the default value from your createContext(defaultValue) call is only used if there is no matching provider above at all. If there is a <SomeContext.Provider value={undefined}> component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling useContext(SomeContext) will receive undefined as the context value.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseCallback\nNEXT\nuseDebugValue"

It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.\n\ndependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm.\n\nReturns \n\nOn the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.\n\nDuring subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn  function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.\n\nCaveats \nuseCallback is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nReact will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should match your expectations if you rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.\nUsage \nSkipping re-rendering of components \n\nWhen you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components. Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful.\n\nTo cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the useCallback Hook:\n\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n  // ...\n\nYou need to pass two things to useCallback:\n\nA function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.\nA list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function.\n\nOn the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from useCallback will be the function you passed.\n\nOn the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useCallback will return the same function as before. Otherwise, useCallback will return the function you passed on this render.\n\nIn other words, useCallback caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nSay you’re passing a handleSubmit function down from the ProductPage to the ShippingForm component:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\nYou’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <ShippingForm /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the ShippingForm component.\n\nBy default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when ProductPage re-renders with a different theme, the ShippingForm component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell ShippingForm to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWith this change, ShippingForm will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is when caching a function becomes important! Let’s say you defined handleSubmit without useCallback:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different function...\n\n  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  \n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ... so ShippingForm's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn JavaScript, a function () {} or () => {} always creates a different function, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that ShippingForm props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useCallback comes in handy:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // Tell React to cache your function between re-renders...\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]); // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ...ShippingForm will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBy wrapping handleSubmit in useCallback, you ensure that it’s the same function between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a function in useCallback unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are other reasons you might need useCallback which are described further on this page.\n\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useCallback back.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is useCallback related to useMemo? \nShow Details\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add useCallback everywhere? \nShow Details\nThe difference between useCallback and declaring a function directly\n1. Skipping re-rendering with useCallback and memo\n2. Always re-rendering a component\nExample 1 of 2: Skipping re-rendering with useCallback and memo \n\nIn this example, the ShippingForm component is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme.\n\nIncrementing the counter feels slow because it forces the slowed down ShippingForm to re-render. That’s expected because the counter has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.\n\nNext, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useCallback together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! ShippingForm skipped re-rendering because the handleSubmit function has not changed. The handleSubmit function has not changed because both productId and referrer (your useCallback dependencies) haven’t changed since last render.\n\nApp.js\nProductPage.js\nShippingForm.js\nReset\nFork\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport ShippingForm from './ShippingForm.js';\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n      referrer,\n      orderDetails,\n    });\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction post(url, data) {\n  // Imagine this sends a request...\n  console.log('POST /' + url);\n  console.log(data);\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating state from a memoized callback \n\nSometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.\n\nThis handleAddTodo function specifies todos as a dependency because it computes the next todos from it:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {\n\n    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };\n\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n\n  }, [todos]);\n\n  // ...\n\nYou’ll usually want memoized functions to have as few dependencies as possible. When you read some state only to calculate the next state, you can remove that dependency by passing an updater function instead:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {\n\n    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };\n\n    setTodos(todos => [...todos, newTodo]);\n\n  }, []); // ✅ No need for the todos dependency\n\n  // ...\n\nHere, instead of making todos a dependency and reading it inside, you pass an instruction about how to update the state (todos => [...todos, newTodo]) to React. Read more about updater functions.\n\nPreventing an Effect from firing too often \n\nSometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  function createOptions() {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nThis creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare createOptions as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render\n\n  // ...\n\nTo solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into useCallback:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const createOptions = useCallback(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when createOptions changes\n\n  // ...\n\nThis ensures that the createOptions function is the same between re-renders if the roomId is the same. However, it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency. Move your function inside the Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    function createOptions() { // ✅ No need for useCallback or function dependencies!\n\n      return {\n\n        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n        roomId: roomId\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your code is simpler and doesn’t need useCallback. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nOptimizing a custom Hook \n\nIf you’re writing a custom Hook, it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into useCallback:\n\nfunction useRouter() {\n\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n\n\n  return {\n\n    navigate,\n\n    goBack,\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.\n\nTroubleshooting \nEvery time my component renders, useCallback returns a different function \n\nMake sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!\n\nIf you forget the dependency array, useCallback will return a new function every time:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }); // 🔴 Returns a new function every time: no dependency array\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]); // ✅ Does not return a new function unnecessarily\n\n  // ...\n\nIf this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    // ..\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  console.log([productId, referrer]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.\n\nI need to call useCallback for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed \n\nSuppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useCallback in a loop:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item => {\n\n        // 🔴 You can't call useCallback in a loop like this:\n\n        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\n          sendReport(item)\n\n        }, [item]);\n\n\n\n        return (\n\n          <figure key={item.id}>\n\n            <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n          </figure>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nInstead, extract a component for an individual item, and put useCallback there:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item =>\n\n        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Report({ item }) {\n\n  // ✅ Call useCallback at the top level:\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\n    sendReport(item)\n\n  }, [item]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, you could remove useCallback in the last snippet and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    sendReport(item);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\nuse\nNEXT\nuseContext"

Instead of a try-catch block wrap your component in an Error Boundary, or provide an alternative value to use with the Promise’s .catch method.\n\nDisplaying an error to users with a error boundary \n\nIf you’d like to display an error to your users when a Promise is rejected, you can use an error boundary. To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the use Hook in an error boundary. If the Promise passed to use is rejected the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.\n\nmessage.js\nReset\nFork\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nexport function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️Something went wrong</p>}>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>⌛Downloading message...</p>}>\n        <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Message({ messagePromise }) {\n  const content = use(messagePromise);\n  return <p>Here is the message: {content}</p>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nProviding an alternative value with Promise.catch \n\nIf you’d like to provide an alternative value when the Promise passed to use is rejected you can use the Promise’s catch method.\n\nimport { Message } from './message.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const messagePromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\n    reject();\n\n  }).catch(() => {\n\n    return \"no new message found.\";\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>waiting for message...</p>}>\n\n      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n\n    </Suspense>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo use the Promise’s catch method, call catch on the Promise object. catch takes a single argument: a function that takes an error message as an argument. Whatever is returned by the function passed to catch will be used as the resolved value of the Promise.\n\nTroubleshooting \n“Suspense Exception: This is not a real error!” \n\nYou are either calling use outside of a React component or Hook function, or calling use in a try–catch block. If you are calling use inside a try–catch block, wrap your component in an error boundary, or call the Promise’s catch to catch the error and resolve the Promise with another value. See these examples.\n\nIf you are calling use outside a React component or Hook function, move the use call to a React component or Hook function.\n\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n\n  function download() {\n\n    // ❌ the function calling `use` is not a Component or Hook\n\n    const message = use(messagePromise);\n\n    // ...\n\nInstead, call use outside any component closures, where the function that calls use is a component or Hook.\n\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n\n  // ✅ `use` is being called from a component. \n\n  const message = use(messagePromise);\n\n  // ...\nPREVIOUS\nHooks\nNEXT\nuseCallback"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nBuilt-in React Hooks\n\nHooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.\n\nState Hooks \n\nState lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.\n\nTo add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseState declares a state variable that you can update directly.\nuseReducer declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.\nfunction ImageGallery() {\n\n  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  // ...\nContext Hooks \n\nContext lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props. For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep.\n\nuseContext reads and subscribes to a context.\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\nRef Hooks \n\nRefs let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs.\n\nuseRef declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.\nuseImperativeHandle lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\nEffect Hooks \n\nEffects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.\n\nuseEffect connects a component to an external system.\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\nEffects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, you might not need an Effect.\n\nThere are two rarely used variations of useEffect with differences in timing:\n\nuseLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.\nuseInsertionEffect fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.\nPerformance Hooks \n\nA common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.\n\nTo skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.\nuseCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).\n\nTo prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseTransition lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.\nuseDeferredValue lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.\nResource Hooks \n\nResources can be accessed by a component without having them as part of their state. For example, a component can read a message from a Promise or read styling information from a context.\n\nTo read a value from a resource, use this Hook:\n\nuse lets you read the value of a resource like a Promise or context.\nfunction MessageComponent({ messagePromise }) {\n\n  const message = use(messagePromise);\n\n  const theme = use(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\nOther Hooks \n\nThese Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code.\n\nuseDebugValue lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.\nuseId lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.\nuseSyncExternalStore lets a component subscribe to an external store.\nYour own Hooks \n\nYou can also define your own custom Hooks as JavaScript functions.\n\nPREVIOUS\nOverview\nNEXT\nuse"
