    "html": "APPENDIX\n\nMigrating from Sapper\nMigrating from Sapper\npackage.json\nProject files\nPages and layouts\nEndpoints\nIntegrations\n\nSvelteKit is the successor to Sapper and shares many elements of its design.\n\nIf you have an existing Sapper app that you plan to migrate to SvelteKit, there are a number of changes you will need to make. You may find it helpful to view some examples while migrating.\n\npackage.json\npermalink\ntype: \"module\"\npermalink\n\nAdd \"type\": \"module\" to your package.json. You can do this step separately from the rest as part of an incremental migration if you are using Sapper 0.29.3 or newer.\n\ndependencies\npermalink\n\nRemove polka or express, if you're using one of those, and any middleware such as sirv or compression.\n\ndevDependencies\npermalink\n\nRemove sapper from your devDependencies and replace it with @sveltejs/kit and whichever adapter you plan to use (see next section).\n\nscripts\npermalink\n\nAny scripts that reference sapper should be updated:\n\nsapper build should become vite build using the Node adapter\nsapper export should become vite build using the static adapter\nsapper dev should become vite dev\nnode __sapper__/build should become node build\nProject files\npermalink\n\nThe bulk of your app, in src/routes, can be left where it is, but several project files will need to be moved or updated.\n\nConfiguration\npermalink\n\nYour webpack.config.js or rollup.config.js should be replaced with a svelte.config.js, as documented here. Svelte preprocessor options should be moved to config.preprocess.\n\nYou will need to add an adapter. sapper build is roughly equivalent to adapter-node while sapper export is roughly equivalent to adapter-static, though you might prefer to use an adapter designed for the platform you're deploying to.\n\nIf you were using plugins for filetypes that are not automatically handled by Vite, you will need to find Vite equivalents and add them to the Vite config.\n\nsrc/client.js\npermalink\n\nThis file has no equivalent in SvelteKit. Any custom logic (beyond sapper.start(...)) should be expressed in your +layout.svelte file, inside an onMount callback.\n\nsrc/server.js\npermalink\n\nWhen using adapter-node the equivalent is a custom server. Otherwise, this file has no direct equivalent, since SvelteKit apps can run in serverless environments.\n\nsrc/service-worker.js\npermalink\n\nMost imports from @sapper/service-worker have equivalents in $service-worker:\n\nfiles is unchanged\nroutes has been removed\nshell is now build\ntimestamp is now version\nsrc/template.html\npermalink\n\nThe src/template.html file should be renamed src/app.html.\n\nRemove %sapper.base%, %sapper.scripts% and %sapper.styles%. Replace %sapper.head% with %sveltekit.head% and %sapper.html% with %sveltekit.body%. The <div id=\"sapper\"> is no longer necessary.\n\nsrc/node_modules\npermalink\n\nA common pattern in Sapper apps is to put your internal library in a directory inside src/node_modules. This doesn't work with Vite, so we use src/lib instead.\n\nPages and layouts\npermalink\nRenamed files\npermalink\n\nRoutes now are made up of the folder name exclusively to remove ambiguity, the folder names leading up to a +page.svelte correspond to the route. See the routing docs for an overview. The following shows a old/new comparison:\n\nOld\tNew\nroutes/about/index.svelte\troutes/about/+page.svelte\nroutes/about.svelte\troutes/about/+page.svelte\n\nYour custom error page component should be renamed from _error.svelte to +error.svelte. Any _layout.svelte files should likewise be renamed +layout.svelte. Any other files are ignored.\n\nImports\npermalink\n\nThe goto, prefetch and prefetchRoutes imports from @sapper/app should be replaced with goto, preloadData and preloadCode imports respectively from $app/navigation.\n\nThe stores import from @sapper/app should be replaced — see the Stores section below.\n\nAny files you previously imported from directories in src/node_modules will need to be replaced with $lib imports.\n\nPreload\npermalink\n\nAs before, pages and layouts can export a function that allows data to be loaded before rendering takes place.\n\nThis function has been renamed from preload to load, it now lives in a +page.js (or +layout.js) next to its +page.svelte (or +layout.svelte), and its API has changed. Instead of two arguments — page and session — there is a single event argument.\n\nThere is no more this object, and consequently no this.fetch, this.error or this.redirect. Instead, you can get fetch from the input methods, and both error and redirect are now thrown.\n\nStores\npermalink\n\nIn Sapper, you would get references to provided stores like so:\n\nimport { stores } from '@sapper/app';\nconst { preloading, page, session } = stores();\n\nThe page store still exists; preloading has been replaced with a navigating store that contains from and to properties. page now has url and params properties, but no path or query.\n\nYou access them differently in SvelteKit. stores is now getStores, but in most cases it is unnecessary since you can import navigating, and page directly from $app/stores.\n\nRouting\npermalink\n\nRegex routes are no longer supported. Instead, use advanced route matching.\n\nSegments\npermalink\n\nPreviously, layout components received a segment prop indicating the child segment. This has been removed; you should use the more flexible $page.url.pathname value to derive the segment you're interested in.\n\nURLs\npermalink\n\nIn Sapper, all relative URLs were resolved against the base URL — usually /, unless the basepath option was used — rather than against the current page.\n\nThis caused problems and is no longer the case in SvelteKit. Instead, relative URLs are resolved against the current page (or the destination page, for fetch URLs in load functions) instead. In most cases, it's easier to use root-relative (i.e. starts with /) URLs, since their meaning is not context-dependent.\n\n<a> attributes\npermalink\nsapper:prefetch is now data-sveltekit-preload-data\nsapper:noscroll is now data-sveltekit-noscroll\nEndpoints\npermalink\n\nIn Sapper, server routes received the req and res objects exposed by Node's http module (or the augmented versions provided by frameworks like Polka and Express).\n\nSvelteKit is designed to be agnostic as to where the app is running — it could be running on a Node server, but could equally be running on a serverless platform or in a Cloudflare Worker. For that reason, you no longer interact directly with req and res. Your endpoints will need to be updated to match the new signature.\n\nTo support this environment-agnostic behavior, fetch is now available in the global context, so you don't need to import node-fetch, cross-fetch, or similar server-side fetch implementations in order to use it.\n\nIntegrations\npermalink\n\nSee integrations for detailed information about integrations.\n\nHTML minifier\npermalink\n\nSapper includes html-minifier by default. SvelteKit does not include this, but you can add it as a prod dependency and then use it through a hook:\n\nimport { minify } from 'html-minifier';\nimport { building } from '$app/environment';\n\n\nconst minification_options = {\n\tcollapseBooleanAttributes: true,\n\tcollapseWhitespace: true,\n\tconservativeCollapse: true,\n\tdecodeEntities: true,\n\thtml5: true,\n\tignoreCustomComments: [/^#/],\n\tminifyCSS: true,\n\tminifyJS: false,\n\tremoveAttributeQuotes: true,\n\tremoveComments: false, // some hydration code needs comments, so leave them in\n\tremoveOptionalTags: true,\n\tremoveRedundantAttributes: true,\n\tremoveScriptTypeAttributes: true,\n\tremoveStyleLinkTypeAttributes: true,\n\tsortAttributes: true,\n\tsortClassName: true\n};\n\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\tlet page = '';\n\n\n\treturn resolve(event, {\n\t\ttransformPageChunk: ({ html, done }) => {\n\t\t\tpage += html;\n\t\t\tif (done) {\n\t\t\t\treturn building ? minify(page, minification_options) : page;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t});\n}\n\nNote that prerendering is false when using vite preview to test the production build of the site, so to verify the results of minifying, you'll need to inspect the built HTML files directly.\n\nPREVIOUS\nIntegrations\nNEXT\nAdditional resources"

The sameSite option defaults to lax.\n\nBy default, the path of a cookie is the current pathname. In most cases you should explicitly set path: '/' to make the cookie available throughout your app.\n\nHandle\npermalink\n\nThe handle hook runs every time the SvelteKit server receives a request and determines the response. It receives an event object representing the request and a function called resolve, which renders the route and generates a Response. This allows you to modify response headers or bodies, or bypass SvelteKit entirely (for implementing routes programmatically, for example).\n\ntype Handle = (input: {\n\tevent: RequestEvent;\n\tresolve(\n\t\tevent: RequestEvent,\n\t\topts?: ResolveOptions\n\t): MaybePromise<Response>;\n}) => MaybePromise<Response>;\nHandleClientError\npermalink\n\nThe client-side handleError hook runs when an unexpected error is thrown while navigating.\n\nIf an unexpected error is thrown during loading or the following render, this function will be called with the error and the event. Make sure that this function never throws an error.\n\ntype HandleClientError = (input: {\n\terror: unknown;\n\tevent: NavigationEvent;\n}) => MaybePromise<void | App.Error>;\nHandleFetch\npermalink\n\nThe handleFetch hook allows you to modify (or replace) a fetch request that happens inside a load function that runs on the server (or during pre-rendering)\n\ntype HandleFetch = (input: {\n\tevent: RequestEvent;\n\trequest: Request;\n\tfetch: typeof fetch;\n}) => MaybePromise<Response>;\nHandleServerError\npermalink\n\nThe server-side handleError hook runs when an unexpected error is thrown while responding to a request.\n\nIf an unexpected error is thrown during loading or rendering, this function will be called with the error and the event. Make sure that this function never throws an error.\n\ntype HandleServerError = (input: {\n\terror: unknown;\n\tevent: RequestEvent;\n}) => MaybePromise<void | App.Error>;\nHttpError\npermalink\n\nThe object returned by the error function.\n\ninterface HttpError {…}\nstatus: number;\n\nThe HTTP status code, in the range 400-599.\n\nbody: App.Error;\n\nThe content of the error.\n\nKitConfig\npermalink\ninterface KitConfig {…}\n\nSee the configuration reference for details.\n\nLoad\npermalink\n\nThe generic form of PageLoad and LayoutLoad. You should import those from ./$types (see generated types) rather than using \nLoad\n directly.\n\ntype Load<\n\tParams extends Partial<Record<string, string>> = Partial<\n\t\tRecord<string, string>\n\t>,\n\tInputData extends Record<string, unknown> | null = Record<\n\t\tstring,\n\t\tany\n\t> | null,\n\tParentData extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<\n\t\tstring,\n\t\tany\n\t>,\n\tOutputData extends Record<\n\t\tstring,\n\t\tunknown\n\t> | void = Record<string, any> | void,\n\tRouteId extends string | null = string | null\n> = (\n\tevent: LoadEvent<Params, InputData, ParentData, RouteId>\n) => MaybePromise<OutputData>;\nLoadEvent\npermalink\n\nThe generic form of PageLoadEvent and LayoutLoadEvent. You should import those from ./$types (see generated types) rather than using \nLoadEvent\n directly.\n\ninterface LoadEvent<\n\tParams extends Partial<Record<string, string>> = Partial<\n\t\tRecord<string, string>\n\t>,\n\tData extends Record<string, unknown> | null = Record<\n\t\tstring,\n\t\tany\n\t> | null,\n\tParentData extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<\n\t\tstring,\n\t\tany\n\t>,\n\tRouteId extends string | null = string | null\n> extends NavigationEvent<Params, RouteId> {…}\nfetch: typeof fetch;\n\nfetch is equivalent to the native fetch web API, with a few additional features:\n\nIt can be used to make credentialed requests on the server, as it inherits the cookie and authorization headers for the page request.\nIt can make relative requests on the server (ordinarily, fetch requires a URL with an origin when used in a server context).\nInternal requests (e.g. for +server.js routes) go directly to the handler function when running on the server, without the overhead of an HTTP call.\nDuring server-side rendering, the response will be captured and inlined into the rendered HTML by hooking into the text and json methods of the Response object. Note that headers will not be serialized, unless explicitly included via filterSerializedResponseHeaders\nDuring hydration, the response will be read from the HTML, guaranteeing consistency and preventing an additional network request.\n\nYou can learn more about making credentialed requests with cookies here\n\ndata: Data;\n\nContains the data returned by the route's server load function (in +layout.server.js or +page.server.js), if any.\n\nsetHeaders(headers: Record<string, string>): void;\n\nIf you need to set headers for the response, you can do so using the this method. This is useful if you want the page to be cached, for example:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/+page.js\nexport async function load({ fetch, setHeaders }) {\n\tconst url = `https://cms.example.com/articles.json`;\n\tconst response = await fetch(url);\n\n\n\tsetHeaders({\n\t\tage: response.headers.get('age'),\n\t\t'cache-control': response.headers.get('cache-control')\n\t});\n\n\n\treturn response.json();\n}\n\nSetting the same header multiple times (even in separate load functions) is an error — you can only set a given header once.\n\nYou cannot add a set-cookie header with setHeaders — use the cookies API in a server-only load function instead.\n\nsetHeaders has no effect when a load function runs in the browser.\n\nparent(): Promise<ParentData>;\n\nawait parent() returns data from parent +layout.js load functions. Implicitly, a missing +layout.js is treated as a ({ data }) => data function, meaning that it will return and forward data from parent +layout.server.js files.\n\nBe careful not to introduce accidental waterfalls when using await parent().

For example, if your .svelte file uses TypeScript and PostCSS, it must first be transformed into JavaScript and CSS so that the Svelte compiler can handle it. There are many available preprocessors. The Svelte team maintains two official ones discussed below.\n\nvitePreprocess\npermalink\n\nvite-plugin-svelte offers a vitePreprocess feature which utilizes Vite for preprocessing. It is capable of handling the language flavors Vite handles: TypeScript, PostCSS, SCSS, Less, Stylus, and SugarSS. For convenience, it is re-exported from the @sveltejs/kit/vite package. If you set your project up with TypeScript it will be included by default:\n\n// svelte.config.js\nimport { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\n\nexport default {\n  preprocess: [vitePreprocess()]\n};\nsvelte-preprocess\npermalink\n\nsvelte-preprocess has some additional functionality not found in vitePreprocess such as support for Pug, Babel, and global styles. However, vitePreprocess may be faster and require less configuration, so it is used by default. Note that CoffeeScript is not supported by SvelteKit.\n\nYou will need to install svelte-preprocess with npm install --save-dev svelte-preprocess and add it to your svelte.config.js. After that, you will often need to install the corresponding library such as npm install -D sass or npm install -D less.\n\nAdders\npermalink\n\nSvelte Adders allow you to setup many different complex integrations like Tailwind, PostCSS, Storybook, Firebase, GraphQL, mdsvex, and more with a single command. Please see sveltesociety.dev for a full listing of templates, components, and tools available for use with Svelte and SvelteKit.\n\nVite plugins\npermalink\n\nSince SvelteKit projects are built with Vite, you can use Vite plugins to enhance your project. See a list of available plugins at vitejs/awesome-vite.\n\nIntegration FAQs\npermalink\n\nThe SvelteKit FAQ has a how to do X with SvelteKit, which may be helpful if you still have questions.\n\nPREVIOUS\nFrequently asked questions\nNEXT\nMigrating from Sapper"

This is not guaranteed to correspond to NODE_ENV or MODE.\n\nconst dev: boolean;\nbuilding\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit analyses your app during the build step by running it. During this process, building is true. This also applies during prerendering.\n\nconst building: boolean;\nversion\npermalink\n\nThe value of config.kit.version.name.\n\nconst version: string;\n$app/forms\npermalink\nimport { applyAction, deserialize, enhance } from '$app/forms';\napplyAction\npermalink\n\nThis action updates the form property of the current page with the given data and updates $page.status. In case of an error, it redirects to the nearest error page.\n\nfunction applyAction<\n\tSuccess extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined,\n\tFailure extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined\n>(\n\tresult: import('@sveltejs/kit').ActionResult<\n\t\tSuccess,\n\t\tFailure\n\t>\n): Promise<void>;\ndeserialize\npermalink\n\nUse this function to deserialize the response from a form submission. Usage:\n\nimport { deserialize } from '$app/forms';\n\n\nasync function handleSubmit(event) {\n  const response = await fetch('/form?/action', {\n\tmethod: 'POST',\n\tbody: new FormData(event.target)\n  });\n\n\n  const result = deserialize(await response.text());\n  // ...\n}\nfunction deserialize<\n\tSuccess extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined,\n\tFailure extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined\n>(\n\tresult: string\n): import('@sveltejs/kit').ActionResult<Success, Failure>;\nenhance\npermalink\n\nThis action enhances a <form> element that otherwise would work without JavaScript.\n\nThe submit function is called upon submission with the given FormData and the action that should be triggered. If cancel is called, the form will not be submitted. You can use the abort controller to cancel the submission in case another one starts. If a function is returned, that function is called with the response from the server. If nothing is returned, the fallback will be used.\n\nIf this function or its return value isn't set, it\n\nfalls back to updating the form prop with the returned data if the action is one same page as the form\nupdates $page.status\nresets the <form> element and invalidates all data in case of successful submission with no redirect response\nredirects in case of a redirect response\nredirects to the nearest error page in case of an unexpected error\n\nIf you provide a custom function with a callback and want to use the default behavior, invoke update in your callback.\n\nfunction enhance<\n\tSuccess extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined,\n\tFailure extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined\n>(\n\tform_element: HTMLFormElement,\n\tsubmit?: import('@sveltejs/kit').SubmitFunction<\n\t\tSuccess,\n\t\tFailure\n\t>\n): {\n\tdestroy(): void;\n};\n$app/navigation\npermalink\nimport {\n\tafterNavigate,\n\tbeforeNavigate,\n\tdisableScrollHandling,\n\tgoto,\n\tinvalidate,\n\tinvalidateAll,\n\tonNavigate,\n\tpreloadCode,\n\tpreloadData\n} from '$app/navigation';\nafterNavigate\npermalink\n\nA lifecycle function that runs the supplied callback when the current component mounts, and also whenever we navigate to a new URL.\n\nafterNavigate must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.\n\nconst afterNavigate: (\n\tcallback: (\n\t\tnavigation: import('@sveltejs/kit').AfterNavigate\n\t) => void\n) => void;\nbeforeNavigate\npermalink\n\nA navigation interceptor that triggers before we navigate to a new URL, whether by clicking a link, calling goto(...), or using the browser back/forward controls. Calling cancel() will prevent the navigation from completing. If the navigation would have directly unloaded the current page, calling cancel will trigger the native browser unload confirmation dialog. In these cases, navigation.willUnload is true.\n\nWhen a navigation isn't client side, navigation.to.route.id will be null.\n\nbeforeNavigate must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.\n\nconst beforeNavigate: (\n\tcallback: (\n\t\tnavigation: import('@sveltejs/kit').BeforeNavigate\n\t) => void\n) => void;\ndisableScrollHandling\npermalink\n\nIf called when the page is being updated following a navigation (in onMount or afterNavigate or an action, for example), this disables SvelteKit's built-in scroll handling. This is generally discouraged, since it breaks user expectations.\n\nconst disableScrollHandling: () => void;\ngoto\npermalink\n\nReturns a Promise that resolves when SvelteKit navigates (or fails to navigate, in which case the promise rejects) to the specified url. For external URLs, use window.location = url instead of calling goto(url).\n\nconst goto: (\n\turl: string | URL,\n\topts?: {\n\t\treplaceState?: boolean;\n\t\tnoScroll?: boolean;\n\t\tkeepFocus?: boolean;\n\t\tinvalidateAll?: boolean;\n\t\tstate?: any;\n\t}\n) => Promise<void>;\ninvalidate\npermalink\n\nCauses any load functions belonging to the currently active page to re-run if they depend on the url in question, via fetch or depends. Returns a Promise that resolves when the page is subsequently updated.\n\nIf the argument is given as a string or URL, it must resolve to the same URL that was passed to fetch or depends (including query parameters). To create a custom identifier, use a string beginning with [a-z]+: (e.g. custom:state) — this is a valid URL.\n\nThe function argument can be used define a custom predicate. It receives the full URL and causes load to rerun if true is returned. This can be useful if you want to invalidate based on a pattern instead of a exact match.\n\n// Example: Match '/path' regardless of the query parameters\nimport { invalidate } from '$app/navigation';\n\n\ninvalidate((url) => url.pathname === '/path');\nconst invalidate: (\n\turl: string | URL | ((url: URL) => boolean)\n) => Promise<void>;\ninvalidateAll\npermalink\n\nCauses all load functions belonging to the currently active page to re-run. Returns a Promise that resolves when the page is subsequently updated.\n\nconst invalidateAll: () => Promise<void>;\nonNavigate\npermalink\n\nA lifecycle function that runs the supplied callback immediately before we navigate to a new URL.\n\nIf you return a Promise, SvelteKit will wait for it to resolve before completing the navigation. This allows you to — for example — use document.startViewTransition. Avoid promises that are slow to resolve, since navigation will appear stalled to the user.\n\nIf a function (or a Promise that resolves to a function) is returned from the callback, it will be called once the DOM has updated.\n\nonNavigate must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.\n\nconst onNavigate: (\n\tcallback: (\n\t\tnavigation: import('@sveltejs/kit').OnNavigate\n\t) => MaybePromise<(() => void) | void>\n) => void;\npreloadCode\npermalink\n\nProgrammatically imports the code for routes that haven't yet been fetched. Typically, you might call this to speed up subsequent navigation.\n\nYou can specify routes by any matching pathname such as /about (to match src/routes/about/+page.svelte) or /blog/* (to match src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte).\n\nUnlike preloadData, this won't call load functions. Returns a Promise that resolves when the modules have been imported.\n\nconst preloadCode: (...urls: string[]) => Promise<void>;\npreloadData\npermalink\n\nProgrammatically preloads the given page, which means\n\nensuring that the code for the page is loaded, and\ncalling the page's load function with the appropriate options.\n\nThis is the same behaviour that SvelteKit triggers when the user taps or mouses over an <a> element with data-sveltekit-preload-data. If the next navigation is to href, the values returned from load will be used, making navigation instantaneous. Returns a Promise that resolves when the preload is complete.\n\nconst preloadData: (href: string) => Promise<void>;\n$app/paths\npermalink\nimport { assets, base } from '$app/paths';\nassets\npermalink\n\nAn absolute path that matches config.kit.paths.assets.\n\nIf a value for config.kit.paths.assets is specified, it will be replaced with '/_svelte_kit_assets' during vite dev or vite preview, since the assets don't yet live at their eventual URL.\n\nlet assets:\n\t| ''\n\t| `https://${string}`\n\t| `http://${string}`\n\t| '/_svelte_kit_assets';\nbase\npermalink\n\nA string that matches config.kit.paths.base.\n\nExample usage: <a href=\"{base}/your-page\">Link</a>\n\nlet base: '' | `/${string}`;\n$app/stores\npermalink\nimport { getStores, navigating, page, updated } from '$app/stores';\ngetStores\npermalink\nfunction getStores(): {\n\tpage: typeof page;\n\n\n\tnavigating: typeof navigating;\n\n\n\tupdated: typeof updated;\n};\nnavigating\npermalink\n\nA readable store. When navigating starts, its value is a \nNavigation\n object with from, to, type and (if type === 'popstate') delta properties. When navigating finishes, its value reverts to null.\n\nOn the server, this store can only be subscribed to during component initialization. In the browser, it can be subscribed to at any time.\n\nconst navigating: import('svelte/store').Readable<\n\timport('@sveltejs/kit').Navigation | null\n>;\npage\npermalink\n\nA readable store whose value contains page data.\n\nOn the server, this store can only be subscribed to during component initialization. In the browser, it can be subscribed to at any time.\n\nconst page: import('svelte/store').Readable<\n\timport('@sveltejs/kit').Page\n>;\nupdated\npermalink\n\nA readable store whose initial value is false. If version.pollInterval is a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions of the app and update the store value to true when it detects one. updated.check() will force an immediate check, regardless of polling.\n\nOn the server, this store can only be subscribed to during component initialization. In the browser, it can be subscribed to at any time.\n\nconst updated: import('svelte/store').Readable<boolean> & {\n\tcheck(): Promise<boolean>;\n};\n$env/dynamic/private\npermalink\n\nThis module provides access to runtime environment variables, as defined by the platform you're running on. For example if you're using adapter-node (or running vite preview), this is equivalent to process.env. This module only includes variables that do not begin with config.kit.env.publicPrefix and do start with config.kit.env.privatePrefix (if configured).\n\nThis module cannot be imported into client-side code.\n\nimport { env } from '$env/dynamic/private';\nconsole.log(env.DEPLOYMENT_SPECIFIC_VARIABLE);\n\nIn dev, $env/dynamic always includes environment variables from .env. In prod, this behavior will depend on your adapter.\n\n$env/dynamic/public\npermalink\n\nSimilar to $env/dynamic/private, but only includes variables that begin with config.kit.env.publicPrefix (which defaults to PUBLIC_), and can therefore safely be exposed to client-side code.\n\nNote that public dynamic environment variables must all be sent from the server to the client, causing larger network requests — when possible, use $env/static/public instead.\n\nimport { env } from '$env/dynamic/public';\nconsole.log(env.PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_SPECIFIC_VARIABLE);\n$env/static/private\npermalink\n\nEnvironment variables loaded by Vite from .env files and process.env. Like $env/dynamic/private, this module cannot be imported into client-side code. This module only includes variables that do not begin with config.kit.env.publicPrefix and do start with config.kit.env.privatePrefix (if configured).\n\nUnlike $env/dynamic/private, the values exported from this module are statically injected into your bundle at build time, enabling optimisations like dead code elimination.\n\nimport { API_KEY } from '$env/static/private';\n\nNote that all environment variables referenced in your code should be declared (for example in an .env file), even if they don't have a value until the app is deployed:\n\nMY_FEATURE_FLAG=\"\"\n\nYou can override .env values from the command line like so:\n\nMY_FEATURE_FLAG=\"enabled\" npm run dev\n$env/static/public\npermalink\n\nSimilar to $env/static/private, except that it only includes environment variables that begin with config.kit.env.publicPrefix (which defaults to PUBLIC_), and can therefore safely be exposed to client-side code.\n\nValues are replaced statically at build time.\n\nimport { PUBLIC_BASE_URL } from '$env/static/public';\n$lib\npermalink\n\nThis is a simple alias to src/lib, or whatever directory is specified as config.kit.files.lib. It allows you to access common components and utility modules without ../../../../ nonsense.\n\n$lib/server\npermalink\n\nA subdirectory of $lib. SvelteKit will prevent you from importing any modules in $lib/server into client-side code. See server-only modules.\n\n$service-worker\npermalink\nimport { base, build, files, prerendered, version } from '$service-worker';\n\nThis module is only available to service workers.\n\nbase\npermalink\n\nThe base path of the deployment. Typically this is equivalent to config.kit.paths.base, but it is calculated from location.pathname meaning that it will continue to work correctly if the site is deployed to a subdirectory. Note that there is a base but no assets, since service workers cannot be used if config.kit.paths.assets is specified.\n\nconst base: string;\nbuild\npermalink\n\nAn array of URL strings representing the files generated by Vite, suitable for caching with cache.addAll(build). During development, this is an empty array.\n\nconst build: string[];\nfiles\npermalink\n\nAn array of URL strings representing the files in your static directory, or whatever directory is specified by config.kit.files.assets. You can customize which files are included from static directory using config.kit.serviceWorker.files\n\nconst files: string[];\nprerendered\npermalink\n\nAn array of pathnames corresponding to prerendered pages and endpoints. During development, this is an empty array.\n\nconst prerendered: string[];\nversion\npermalink\n\nSee config.kit.version. It's useful for generating unique cache names inside your service worker, so that a later deployment of your app can invalidate old caches.\n\nconst version: string;\n@sveltejs/kit\npermalink\nimport {\n\tVERSION,\n\terror,\n\tfail,\n\tjson,\n\tredirect,\n\tresolvePath,\n\ttext\n} from '@sveltejs/kit';\nVERSION\npermalink\nconst VERSION: string;\nerror\npermalink\nfunction error(\n\tstatus: number,\n\tbody: App.Error\n): HttpError_1;\nerror\npermalink\nfunction error(\n\tstatus: number,\n\tbody?: {\n\t\tmessage: string;\n\t} extends App.Error\n\t\t? App.Error | string | undefined\n\t\t: never\n): HttpError_1;\nfail\npermalink\n\nCreate an \nActionFailure\n object.\n\nfunction fail<\n\tT extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined = undefined\n>(status: number, data?: T | undefined): ActionFailure<T>;\njson\npermalink\n\nCreate a JSON Response object from the supplied data.\n\nfunction json(\n\tdata: any,\n\tinit?: ResponseInit | undefined\n): Response;\nredirect\npermalink\n\nCreate a \nRedirect\n object. If thrown during request handling, SvelteKit will return a redirect response. Make sure you're not catching the thrown redirect, which would prevent SvelteKit from handling it.\n\nfunction redirect(\n\tstatus:\n\t\t| 300\n\t\t| 301\n\t\t| 302\n\t\t| 303\n\t\t| 304\n\t\t| 305\n\t\t| 306\n\t\t| 307\n\t\t| 308,\n\tlocation: string | URL\n): Redirect_1;\nresolvePath\npermalink\n\nPopulate a route ID with params to resolve a pathname.\n\nfunction resolvePath(\n\tid: string,\n\tparams: Record<string, string | undefined>\n): string;\ntext\npermalink\n\nCreate a Response object from the supplied body.\n\nfunction text(\n\tbody: string,\n\tinit?: ResponseInit | undefined\n): Response;\n@sveltejs/kit/hooks\npermalink\nimport { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks';\nsequence\npermalink\n\nA helper function for sequencing multiple handle calls in a middleware-like manner. The behavior for the handle options is as follows:\n\ntransformPageChunk is applied in reverse order and merged\npreload is applied in forward order, the first option \"wins\" and no preload options after it are called\nfilterSerializedResponseHeaders behaves the same as preload\nsrc/hooks.server.js\nimport { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks';\n\n\n/// type: import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle\nasync function first({ event, resolve }) {\n\tconsole.log('first pre-processing');\n\tconst result = await resolve(event, {\n\t\ttransformPageChunk: ({ html }) => {\n\t\t\t// transforms are applied in reverse order\n\t\t\tconsole.log('first transform');\n\t\t\treturn html;\n\t\t},\n\t\tpreload: () => {\n\t\t\t// this one wins as it's the first defined in the chain\n\t\t\tconsole.log('first preload');\n\t\t}\n\t});\n\tconsole.log('first post-processing');\n\treturn result;\n}\n\n\n/// type: import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle\nasync function second({ event, resolve }) {\n\tconsole.log('second pre-processing');\n\tconst result = await resolve(event, {\n\t\ttransformPageChunk: ({ html }) => {\n\t\t\tconsole.log('second transform');\n\t\t\treturn html;\n\t\t},\n\t\tpreload: () => {\n\t\t\tconsole.log('second preload');\n\t\t},\n\t\tfilterSerializedResponseHeaders: () => {\n\t\t\t// this one wins as it's the first defined in the chain\n\t\t   console.log('second filterSerializedResponseHeaders');\n\t\t}\n\t});\n\tconsole.log('second post-processing');\n\treturn result;\n}\n\n\nexport const handle = sequence(first, second);\n\nThe example above would print:\n\nfirst pre-processing\nfirst preload\nsecond pre-processing\nsecond filterSerializedResponseHeaders\nsecond transform\nfirst transform\nsecond post-processing\nfirst post-processing\nfunction sequence(\n\t...handlers: import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle[]\n): import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle;\n@sveltejs/kit/node\npermalink\nimport { getRequest, setResponse } from '@sveltejs/kit/node';\ngetRequest\npermalink\nfunction getRequest({\n\trequest,\n\tbase,\n\tbodySizeLimit\n}: {\n\trequest: import('http').IncomingMessage;\n\tbase: string;\n\tbodySizeLimit?: number;\n}): Promise<Request>;\nsetResponse\npermalink\nfunction setResponse(\n\tres: import('http').ServerResponse,\n\tresponse: Response\n): Promise<void>;\n@sveltejs/kit/node/polyfills\npermalink\nimport { installPolyfills } from '@sveltejs/kit/node/polyfills';\ninstallPolyfills\npermalink\n\nMake various web APIs available as globals:\n\ncrypto\nfetch (only in node < 18.11)\nHeaders (only in node < 18.11)\nRequest (only in node < 18.11)\nResponse (only in node < 18.11)\nfunction installPolyfills(): void;\n@sveltejs/kit/vite\npermalink\nimport { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\nsveltekit\npermalink\n\nReturns the SvelteKit Vite plugins.\n\nfunction sveltekit(): Promise<import('vite').Plugin[]>;\nPREVIOUS\nCommand Line Interface\nNEXT\nTypes"

There are three strategies with different trade-offs:\n\nmodulepreload - uses <link rel=\"modulepreload\">. This delivers the best results in Chromium-based browsers, in Firefox 115+, and Safari 17+. It is ignored in older browsers.\npreload-js - uses <link rel=\"preload\">. Prevents waterfalls in Chromium and Safari, but Chromium will parse each module twice (once as a script, once as a module). Causes modules to be requested twice in Firefox. This is a good setting if you want to maximise performance for users on iOS devices at the cost of a very slight degradation for Chromium users.\npreload-mjs - uses <link rel=\"preload\"> but with the .mjs extension which prevents double-parsing in Chromium. Some static webservers will fail to serve .mjs files with a Content-Type: application/javascript header, which will cause your application to break. If that doesn't apply to you, this is the option that will deliver the best performance for the largest number of users, until modulepreload is more widely supported.\npaths\npermalink\nassets?: '' | `http://${string}` | `https://${string}`;\nDEFAULT \"\"\n\nAn absolute path that your app's files are served from. This is useful if your files are served from a storage bucket of some kind.\n\nbase?: '' | `/${string}`;\nDEFAULT \"\"\n\nA root-relative path that must start, but not end with / (e.g. /base-path), unless it is the empty string. This specifies where your app is served from and allows the app to live on a non-root path. Note that you need to prepend all your root-relative links with the base value or they will point to the root of your domain, not your base (this is how the browser works). You can use base from $app/paths for that: <a href=\"{base}/your-page\">Link</a>. If you find yourself writing this often, it may make sense to extract this into a reusable component.\n\nrelative?: boolean | undefined;\nDEFAULT undefined\n\nWhether to use relative asset paths. By default, if paths.assets is not external, SvelteKit will replace %sveltekit.assets% with a relative path and use relative paths to reference build artifacts, but base and assets imported from $app/paths will be as specified in your config.\n\nIf true, base and assets imported from $app/paths will be replaced with relative asset paths during server-side rendering, resulting in portable HTML. If false, %sveltekit.assets% and references to build artifacts will always be root-relative paths, unless paths.assets is an external URL\n\nIf your app uses a <base> element, you should set this to false, otherwise asset URLs will incorrectly be resolved against the <base> URL rather than the current page.\n\nprerender\npermalink\n\nSee Prerendering.\n\nconcurrency?: number;\nDEFAULT 1\n\nHow many pages can be prerendered simultaneously.

This is useful for extending a shared tsconfig.json in a monorepo root, for example.\n\nversion\npermalink\n\nClient-side navigation can be buggy if you deploy a new version of your app while people are using it. If the code for the new page is already loaded, it may have stale content; if it isn't, the app's route manifest may point to a JavaScript file that no longer exists. SvelteKit helps you solve this problem through version management. If SvelteKit encounters an error while loading the page and detects that a new version has been deployed (using the name specified here, which defaults to a timestamp of the build) it will fall back to traditional full-page navigation. Not all navigations will result in an error though, for example if the JavaScript for the next page is already loaded. If you still want to force a full-page navigation in these cases, use techniques such as setting the pollInterval and then using beforeNavigate:\n\n+layout.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { beforeNavigate } from '$app/navigation';\n\timport { updated } from '$app/stores';\n\n\tbeforeNavigate(({ willUnload, to }) => {\n\t\tif ($updated && !willUnload && to?.url) {\n\t\t\tlocation.href = to.url.href;\n\t\t}\n\t});\n</script>\n\nIf you set pollInterval to a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions in the background and set the value of the updated store to true when it detects one.\n\nname?: string;\n\nThe current app version string. If specified, this must be deterministic (e.g. a commit ref rather than Math.random() or Date.now().toString()), otherwise defaults to a timestamp of the build.\n\nFor example, to use the current commit hash, you could do use git rev-parse HEAD:\n\nsvelte.config.js\nimport * as child_process from 'node:child_process';\n\n\nexport default {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tversion: {\n\t\t\tname: child_process.execSync('git rev-parse HEAD').toString().trim()\n\t\t}\n\t}\n};\npollInterval?: number;\nDEFAULT 0\n\nThe interval in milliseconds to poll for version changes. If this is 0, no polling occurs.\n\nPREVIOUS\nSEO\nNEXT\nCommand Line Interface"

However, there are a few technical considerations for building sites that rank well.\n\nOut of the box\npermalink\nSSR\npermalink\n\nWhile search engines have got better in recent years at indexing content that was rendered with client-side JavaScript, server-side rendered content is indexed more frequently and reliably. SvelteKit employs SSR by default, and while you can disable it in handle, you should leave it on unless you have a good reason not to.\n\nSvelteKit's rendering is highly configurable and you can implement dynamic rendering if necessary. It's not generally recommended, since SSR has other benefits beyond SEO.\n\nPerformance\npermalink\n\nSignals such as Core Web Vitals impact search engine ranking. Because Svelte and SvelteKit introduce minimal overhead, it's easier to build high performance sites. You can test your site's performance using Google's PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse.\n\nNormalized URLs\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit redirects pathnames with trailing slashes to ones without (or vice versa depending on your configuration), as duplicate URLs are bad for SEO.\n\nManual setup\npermalink\n<title> and <meta>\npermalink\n\nEvery page should have well-written and unique <title> and <meta name=\"description\"> elements inside a <svelte:head>. Guidance on how to write descriptive titles and descriptions, along with other suggestions on making content understandable by search engines, can be found on Google's Lighthouse SEO audits documentation.\n\nA common pattern is to return SEO-related data from page load functions, then use it (as $page.data) in a <svelte:head> in your root layout.\n\nStructured data\npermalink\n\nStructured data helps search engines understand the content of a page. If you're using structured data alongside svelte-preprocess, you will need to explicitly preserve ld+json data (this may change in future):\n\nsvelte.config.js\nimport preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess';\n\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\nconst config = {\n\tpreprocess: preprocess({\n\t\tpreserve: ['ld+json']\n\t\t// ...\n\t})\n};\n\n\nexport default config;\nSitemaps\npermalink\n\nSitemaps help search engines prioritize pages within your site, particularly when you have a large amount of content. You can create a sitemap dynamically using an endpoint:\n\nsrc/routes/sitemap.xml/+server.js\nexport async function GET() {\n\treturn new Response(\n\t\t`\n\t\t<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n\t\t<urlset\n\t\t\txmlns=\"https://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\"\n\t\t\txmlns:xhtml=\"https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n\t\t\txmlns:mobile=\"https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-mobile/1.0\"\n\t\t\txmlns:news=\"https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-news/0.9\"\n\t\t\txmlns:image=\"https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1\"\n\t\t\txmlns:video=\"https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-video/1.1\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<!-- <url> elements go here -->\n\t\t</urlset>`.trim(),\n\t\t{\n\t\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t\t'Content-Type': 'application/xml'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t);\n}\nAMP\npermalink\n\nAn unfortunate reality of modern web development is that it is sometimes necessary to create an Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) version of your site. In SvelteKit this can be done by setting the inlineStyleThreshold option...\n\nsvelte.config.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\nconst config = {\n\tkit: {\n\t\t// since <link rel=\"stylesheet\"> isn't\n\t\t// allowed, inline all styles\n\t\tinlineStyleThreshold: Infinity\n\t}\n};\n\n\nexport default config;\n\n...disabling csr in your root +layout.js/+layout.server.js...\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.server.js\nexport const csr = false;\n\n...adding amp to your app.html\n\n<html amp>\n...\n\n...and transforming the HTML using transformPageChunk along with transform imported from @sveltejs/amp:\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\nimport * as amp from '@sveltejs/amp';\n\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\tlet buffer = '';\n\treturn await resolve(event, {\n\t\ttransformPageChunk: ({ html, done }) => {\n\t\t\tbuffer += html;\n\t\t\tif (done) return amp.transform(buffer);\n\t\t}\n\t});\n}\n\nTo prevent shipping any unused CSS as a result of transforming the page to amp, we can use dropcss:\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\nimport * as amp from '@sveltejs/amp';\nimport dropcss from 'dropcss';\n\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\tlet buffer = '';\n\n\n\treturn await resolve(event, {\n\t\ttransformPageChunk: ({ html, done }) => {\n\t\t\tbuffer += html;\n\n\n\t\t\tif (done) {\n\t\t\t\tlet css = '';\n\t\t\t\tconst markup = amp\n\t\t\t\t\t.transform(buffer)\n\t\t\t\t\t.replace('⚡', 'amp') // dropcss can't handle this character\n\t\t\t\t\t.replace(/<style amp-custom([^>]*?)>([^]+?)<\\/style>/, (match, attributes, contents) => {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcss = contents;\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn `<style amp-custom${attributes}></style>`;\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\n\n\t\t\t\tcss = dropcss({ css, html: markup }).css;\n\t\t\t\treturn markup.replace('</style>', `${css}</style>`);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t});\n}\n\n\n\nIt's a good idea to use the handle hook to validate the transformed HTML using amphtml-validator, but only if you're prerendering pages since it's very slow.\n\nPREVIOUS\nAccessibility\nNEXT\nConfiguration"

    "html": "BEST PRACTICES\n\nAccessibility\nAccessibility\nRoute announcements\nFocus management\nThe \"lang\" attribute\nFurther reading\n\nSvelteKit strives to provide an accessible platform for your app by default. Svelte's compile-time accessibility checks will also apply to any SvelteKit application you build.\n\nHere's how SvelteKit's built-in accessibility features work and what you need to do to help these features to work as well as possible. Keep in mind that while SvelteKit provides an accessible foundation, you are still responsible for making sure your application code is accessible. If you're new to accessibility, see the \"further reading\" section of this guide for additional resources.\n\nWe recognize that accessibility can be hard to get right. If you want to suggest improvements to how SvelteKit handles accessibility, please open a GitHub issue.\n\nRoute announcements\npermalink\n\nIn traditional server-rendered applications, every navigation (e.g. clicking on an <a> tag) triggers a full page reload. When this happens, screen readers and other assistive technology will read out the new page's title so that users understand that the page has changed.\n\nSince navigation between pages in SvelteKit happens without reloading the page (known as client-side routing), SvelteKit injects a live region onto the page that will read out the new page name after each navigation. This determines the page name to announce by inspecting the <title> element.\n\nBecause of this behavior, every page in your app should have a unique, descriptive title. In SvelteKit, you can do this by placing a <svelte:head> element on each page:\n\nsrc/routes/+page.svelte\n<svelte:head>\n\t<title>Todo List</title>\n</svelte:head>\n\nThis will allow screen readers and other assistive technology to identify the new page after a navigation occurs. Providing a descriptive title is also important for SEO.\n\nFocus management\npermalink\n\nIn traditional server-rendered applications, every navigation will reset focus to the top of the page. This ensures that people browsing the web with a keyboard or screen reader will start interacting with the page from the beginning.\n\nTo simulate this behavior during client-side routing, SvelteKit focuses the <body> element after each navigation and enhanced form submission. There is one exception - if an element with the autofocus attribute is present, SvelteKit will focus that element instead. Make sure to consider the implications for assistive technology when using that attribute.\n\nIf you want to customize SvelteKit's focus management, you can use the afterNavigate hook:\n\nimport { afterNavigate } from '$app/navigation';\n\n\nafterNavigate(() => {\n\t/** @type {HTMLElement | null} */\n\tconst to_focus = document.querySelector('.focus-me');\n\tto_focus?.focus();\n});\n\nYou can also programmatically navigate to a different page using the goto function. By default, this will have the same client-side routing behavior as clicking on a link. However, goto also accepts a keepFocus option that will preserve the currently-focused element instead of resetting focus. If you enable this option, make sure the currently-focused element still exists on the page after navigation. If the element no longer exists, the user's focus will be lost, making for a confusing experience for assistive technology users.\n\nThe \"lang\" attribute\npermalink\n\nBy default, SvelteKit's page template sets the default language of the document to English. If your content is not in English, you should update the <html> element in src/app.html to have the correct lang attribute. This will ensure that any assistive technology reading the document uses the correct pronunciation. For example, if your content is in German, you should update app.html to the following:\n\nsrc/app.html\n<html lang=\"de\">\n\nIf your content is available in multiple languages, you should set the lang attribute based on the language of the current page. You can do this with SvelteKit's handle hook:\n\nsrc/app.html\n<html lang=\"%lang%\">\nsrc/hooks.server.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\treturn resolve(event, {\n\t\ttransformPageChunk: ({ html }) => html.replace('%lang%', get_lang(event))\n\t});\n}\nFurther reading\npermalink\n\nFor the most part, building an accessible SvelteKit app is the same as building an accessible web app. You should be able to apply information from the following general accessibility resources to any web experience you build:\n\nMDN Web Docs: Accessibility\nThe A11y Project\nHow to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)\nPREVIOUS\nPackaging\nNEXT\nSEO"

    "html": "ADVANCED\n\nPackaging\nPackaging\nAnatomy of a package.json\nTypeScript\nBest practices\nOptions\nPublishing\nCaveats\n\nYou can use SvelteKit to build apps as well as component libraries, using the @sveltejs/package package (npm create svelte has an option to set this up for you).\n\nWhen you're creating an app, the contents of src/routes is the public-facing stuff; src/lib contains your app's internal library.\n\nA component library has the exact same structure as a SvelteKit app, except that src/lib is the public-facing bit, and your root package.json is used to publish the package. src/routes might be a documentation or demo site that accompanies the library, or it might just be a sandbox you use during development.\n\nRunning the svelte-package command from @sveltejs/package will take the contents of src/lib and generate a dist directory (which can be configured) containing the following:\n\nAll the files in src/lib. Svelte components will be preprocessed, TypeScript files will be transpiled to JavaScript.\nType definitions (d.ts files) which are generated for Svelte, JavaScript and TypeScript files. You need to install typescript >= 4.0.0 for this. Type definitions are placed next to their implementation, hand-written d.ts files are copied over as is. You can disable generation, but we strongly recommend against it — people using your library might use TypeScript, for which they require these type definition files.\n\n@sveltejs/package version 1 generated a package.json. This is no longer the case and it will now use the package.json from your project and validate that it is correct instead. If you're still on version 1, see this PR for migration instructions.\n\nAnatomy of a package.json\npermalink\n\nSince you're now building a library for public use, the contents of your package.json will become more important. Through it, you configure the entry points of your package, which files are published to npm, and which dependencies your library has. Let's go through the most important fields one by one.\n\nname\npermalink\n\nThis is the name of your package. It will be available for others to install using that name, and visible on https://npmjs.com/package/<name>.\n\n{\n\t\"name\": \"your-library\"\n}\n\nRead more about it here.\n\nlicense\npermalink\n\nEvery package should have a license field so people know how they are allowed to use it. A very popular license which is also very permissive in terms of distribution and reuse without warranty is MIT.\n\n{\n\t\"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\n\nRead more about it here. Note that you should also include a LICENSE file in your package.\n\nfiles\npermalink\n\nThis tells npm which files it will pack up and upload to npm. It should contain your output folder (dist by default). Your package.json and README and LICENSE will always be included, so you don't need to specify them.\n\n{\n\t\"files\": [\"dist\"]\n}\n\nTo exclude unnecessary files (such as unit tests, or modules that are only imported from src/routes etc) you can add them to an .npmignore file. This will result in smaller packages that are faster to install.\n\nRead more about it here.\n\nexports\npermalink\n\nThe \"exports\" field contains the package's entry points. If you set up a new library project through npm create svelte@latest, it's set to a single export, the package root:\n\n{\n\t\"exports\": {\n\t\t\".\": {\n\t\t\t\"types\": \"./dist/index.d.ts\",\n\t\t\t\"svelte\": \"./dist/index.js\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nThis tells bundlers and tooling that your package only has one entry point, the root, and everything should be imported through that, like this:\n\nimport { Something } from 'your-library';\n\nThe types and svelte keys are export conditions. They tell tooling what file to import when they look up the your-library import:\n\nTypeScript sees the types condition and looks up the type definition file. If you don't publish type definitions, omit this condition.\nSvelte-aware tooling sees the svelte condition and knows this is a Svelte component library. If you publish a library that does not export any Svelte components and that could also work in non-Svelte projects (for example a Svelte store library), you can replace this condition with default.\n\nPrevious versions of @sveltejs/package also added a package.json export. This is no longer part of the template because all tooling can now deal with a package.json not being explicitly exported.\n\nYou can adjust exports to your liking and provide more entry points. For example, if instead of a src/lib/index.js file that re-exported components you wanted to expose a src/lib/Foo.svelte component directly, you could create the following export map...\n\n{\n\t\"exports\": {\n\t\t\"./Foo.svelte\": {\n\t\t\t\"types\": \"./dist/Foo.svelte.d.ts\",\n\t\t\t\"svelte\": \"./dist/Foo.svelte\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n...and a consumer of your library could import the component like so:\n\nimport Foo from 'your-library/Foo.svelte';\n\nBeware that doing this will need additional care if you provide type definitions. Read more about the caveat here\n\nIn general, each key of the exports map is the path the user will have to use to import something from your package, and the value is the path to the file that will be imported or a map of export conditions which in turn contains these file paths.\n\nRead more about exports here.\n\nsvelte\npermalink\n\nThis is a legacy field that enabled tooling to recognise Svelte component libraries. It's no longer necessary when using the svelte export condition, but for backwards compatibility with outdated tooling that doesn't yet know about export conditions it's good to keep it around. It should point towards your root entry point.\n\n{\n\t\"svelte\": \"./dist/index.js\"\n}\nTypeScript\npermalink\n\nYou should ship type definitions for your library even if you don't use TypeScript yourself so that people who do get proper intellisense when using your library. @sveltejs/package makes the process of generating types mostly opaque to you. By default, when packaging your library, type definitions are auto-generated for JavaScript, TypeScript and Svelte files. All you need to ensure is that the types condition in the exports map points to the correct files. When initialising a library project through npm create svelte@latest, this is automatically setup for the root export.\n\nIf you have something else than a root export however — for example providing a your-library/foo import — you need to take additional care for providing type definitions. Unfortunately, TypeScript by default will not resolve the types condition for an export like { \"./foo\": { \"types\": \"./dist/foo.d.ts\", ... }}. Instead, it will search for a foo.d.ts relative to the root of your library (i.e. your-library/foo.d.ts instead of your-library/dist/foo.d.ts). To fix this, you have two options:\n\nThe first option is to require people using your library to set the moduleResolution option in their tsconfig.json (or jsconfig.json) to bundler (available since TypeScript 5, the best and recommended option in the future), node16 or nodenext. This opts TypeScript into actually looking at the exports map and resolving the types correctly.\n\nThe second option is to (ab)use the typesVersions feature from TypeScript to wire up the types. This is a field inside package.json TypeScript uses to check for different type definitions depending on the TypeScript version, and also contains a path mapping feature for that. We leverage that path mapping feature to get what we want. For the mentioned foo export above, the corresponding typesVersions looks like this:\n\n{\n\t\"exports\": {\n\t\t\"./foo\": {\n\t\t\t\"types\": \"./dist/foo.d.ts\",\n\t\t\t\"svelte\": \"./dist/foo.js\"\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t\"typesVersions\": {\n\t\t\">4.0\": {\n\t\t\t\"foo\": [\"./dist/foo.d.ts\"]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n>4.0 tells TypeScript to check the inner map if the used TypeScript version is greater than 4 (which should in practice always be true). The inner map tells TypeScript that the typings for your-library/foo are found within ./dist/foo.d.ts, which essentially replicates the exports condition. You also have * as a wildcard at your disposal to make many type definitions at once available without repeating yourself. Note that if you opt into typesVersions you have to declare all type imports through it, including the root import (which is defined as \"index.d.ts\": [..]).\n\nYou can read more about that feature here.\n\nBest practices\npermalink\n\nYou should avoid using SvelteKit-specific modules like $app in your packages unless you intend for them to only be consumable by other SvelteKit projects. E.g. rather than using import { browser } from '$app/environment' you could use import { BROWSER } from 'esm-env' (see esm-env docs). You may also wish to pass in things like the current URL or a navigation action as a prop rather than relying directly on $app/stores, $app/navigation, etc. Writing your app in this more generic fashion will also make it easier to setup tools for testing, UI demos and so on.\n\nEnsure that you add aliases via svelte.config.js (not vite.config.js or tsconfig.json), so that they are processed by svelte-package.\n\nYou should think carefully about whether or not the changes you make to your package are a bug fix, a new feature, or a breaking change, and update the package version accordingly. Note that if you remove any paths from exports or any export conditions inside them from your existing library, that should be regarded as a breaking change.\n\n{\n\t\"exports\": {\n\t\t\".\": {\n\t\t\t\"types\": \"./dist/index.d.ts\",\n// changing `svelte` to `default` is a breaking change:\n\t\t\t\"svelte\": \"./dist/index.js\"\n\t\t\t\"default\": \"./dist/index.js\"\n\t\t},\n// removing this is a breaking change:\n\t\t\"./foo\": {\n\t\t\t\"types\": \"./dist/foo.d.ts\",\n\t\t\t\"svelte\": \"./dist/foo.js\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": \"./dist/foo.js\"\n\t\t},\n// adding this is ok:\n\t\t\"./bar\": {\n\t\t\t\"types\": \"./dist/bar.d.ts\",\n\t\t\t\"svelte\": \"./dist/bar.js\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": \"./dist/bar.js\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nOptions\npermalink\n\nsvelte-package accepts the following options:\n\n-w/--watch — watch files in src/lib for changes and rebuild the package\n-i/--input — the input directory which contains all the files of the package. Defaults to src/lib\n-o/--o — the output directory where the processed files are written to. Your package.json's exports should point to files inside there, and the files array should include that folder. Defaults to dist\n-t/--types — whether or not to create type definitions (d.ts files). We strongly recommend doing this as it fosters ecosystem library quality. Defaults to true\nPublishing\npermalink\n\nTo publish the generated package:\n\nnpm publish\nCaveats\npermalink\n\nAll relative file imports need to be fully specified, adhering to Node's ESM algorithm. This means that for a file like src/lib/something/index.js, you must include the filename with the extension:\n\nimport { something } from './something';\nimport { something } from './something/index.js';\n\n\nIf you are using TypeScript, you need to import .ts files the same way, but using a .js file ending, not a .ts file ending. (This is a TypeScript design decision outside our control.) Setting \"moduleResolution\": \"NodeNext\" in your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json will help you with this.\n\nAll files except Svelte files (preprocessed) and TypeScript files (transpiled to JavaScript) are copied across as-is.\n\nPREVIOUS\nSnapshots\nNEXT\nAccessibility"

For best results, you should optimize them by doing the following:\n\ngenerate optimal formats like .avif and .webp\ncreate different sizes for different screens\nensure that assets can be cached effectively\n\nDoing this manually is tedious. There are a variety of techniques you can use, depending on your needs and preferences.\n\nVite's built-in handling\npermalink\n\nVite will automatically process imported assets for improved performance. This includes assets referenced via the CSS url() function. Hashes will be added to the filenames so that they can be cached, and assets smaller than assetsInlineLimit will be inlined. Vite's asset handling is most often used for images, but is also useful for video, audio, etc.\n\n<script>\n\timport logo from '$lib/assets/logo.png';\n</script>\n\n<img alt=\"The project logo\" src={logo} />\n@sveltejs/enhanced-img\npermalink\n\nWARNING: The @sveltejs/enhanced-img package is experimental. It uses pre-1.0 versioning and may introduce breaking changes with every minor version release.\n\n@sveltejs/enhanced-img builds on top of Vite's built-in asset handling. It offers plug and play image processing that serves smaller file formats like avif or webp, automatically sets the intrinsic width and height of the image to avoid layout shift, creates images of multiple sizes for various devices, and strips EXIF data for privacy. It will work in any Vite-based project including, but not limited to, SvelteKit projects.\n\nSetup\npermalink\n\nInstall:\n\nnpm install --save-dev @sveltejs/enhanced-img\n\nAdjust vite.config.js:\n\nimport { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\nimport { enhancedImages } from '@sveltejs/enhanced-img';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\tplugins: [\n\t\tenhancedImages(),\n\t\tsveltekit()\n\t]\n});\n\nBasic usage\npermalink\n\nUse in your .svelte components by using <enhanced:img> rather than <img> and referencing the image file with a Vite asset import path:\n\n<enhanced:img src=\"./path/to/your/image.jpg\" alt=\"An alt text\" />\n\nAt build time, your <enhanced:img> tag will be replaced with an <img> wrapped by a <picture> providing multiple image types and sizes. It's only possible to downscale images without losing quality, which means that you should provide the highest resolution image that you need — smaller versions will be generated for the various device types that may request an image.\n\nYou should provide your image at 2x resolution for HiDPI displays (a.k.a. retina displays). <enhanced:img> will automatically take care of serving smaller versions to smaller devices.\n\nIf you wish to add styles to your <enhanced:img>, you should add a class and target that.\n\nDynamically choosing an image\npermalink\n\nYou can also manually import an image asset and pass it to an <enhanced:img>. This is useful when you have a collection of static images and would like to dynamically choose one or iterate over them. In this case you will need to update both the import statement and <img> element as shown below to indicate you'd like process them.\n\n<script>\n\timport MyImage from './path/to/your/image.jpg?enhanced';\n</script>\n\n<enhanced:img src={MyImage} alt=\"Some alt text\" />\n\nYou can also use Vite's import.meta.glob. Note that you will have to specify enhanced via a custom query:\n\nconst pictures = import.meta.glob(\n\t'/path/to/assets/*.{avif,gif,heif,jpeg,jpg,png,tiff,webp}',\n\t{\n\t\tquery: {\n\t\t\tenhanced: true\n\t\t}\n\t}\n);\nIntrinsic Dimensions\npermalink\n\nwidth and height are optional as they can be inferred from the source image and will be automatically added when the <enhanced:img> tag is preprocessed. With these attributes, the browser can reserve the correct amount of space, preventing layout shift. If you'd like to use a different width and height you can style the image with CSS. Because the preprocessor adds a width and height for you, if you'd like one of the dimensions to be automatically calculated then you will need to specify that:\n\n<style>\n\t.hero-image img {\n\t\twidth: var(--size);\n\t\theight: auto;\n\t}\n</style>\nsrcset and sizes\npermalink\n\nIf you have a large image, such as a hero image taking the width of the design, you should specify sizes so that smaller versions are requested on smaller devices. E.g. if you have a 1280px image you may want to specify something like:\n\n<enhanced:img src=\"./image.png\" sizes=\"min(1280px, 100vw)\"/>\n\nIf sizes is specified, <enhanced:img> will generate small images for smaller devices and populate the srcset attribute.\n\nThe smallest picture generated automatically will have a width of 540px. If you'd like smaller images or would otherwise like to specify custom widths, you can do that with the w query parameter:\n\n<enhanced:img\n  src=\"./image.png?w=1280;640;400\"\n  sizes=\"(min-width:1920px) 1280px, (min-width:1080px) 640px, (min-width:768px) 400px\"\n/>\n\nIf sizes is not provided, then a HiDPI/Retina image and a standard resolution image will be generated. The image you provide should be 2x the resolution you wish to display so that the browser can display that image on devices with a high device pixel ratio.\n\nPer-image transforms\npermalink\n\nBy default, enhanced images will be transformed to more efficient formats. However, you may wish to apply other transforms such as a blur, quality, flatten, or rotate operation. You can run per-image transforms by appending a query string:\n\n<enhanced:img src=\"./path/to/your/image.jpg?blur=15\" alt=\"An alt text\" />\n\nSee the imagetools repo for the full list of directives.\n\nLoading images dynamically from a CDN\npermalink\n\nIn some cases, the images may not be accessible at build time — e.g. they may live inside a content management system or elsewhere.\n\nUsing a content delivery network (CDN) can allow you to optimize these images dynamically, and provides more flexibility with regards to sizes, but it may involve some setup overhead and usage costs. Depending on caching strategy, the browser may not be able to use a cached copy of the asset until a 304 response is received from the CDN. Building HTML to target CDNs may result in slightly smaller and simpler HTML because they can serve the appropriate file format for an <img> tag based on the User-Agent header whereas build-time optimizations must produce <picture> tags with multiple sources. Finally, some CDNs may generate images lazily, which could have a negative performance impact for sites with low traffic and frequently changing images.\n\nCDNs can generally be used without any need for a library. However, there are a number of libraries with Svelte support that make it easier. @unpic/svelte is a CDN-agnostic library with support for a large number of providers. You may also find that specific CDNs like Cloudinary have Svelte support. Finally, some content management systems (CMS) which support Svelte (such as Contentful, Storyblok, and Contentstack) have built-in support for image handling.\n\nBest practices\npermalink\nFor each image type, use the appropriate solution from those discussed above. You can mix and match all three solutions in one project. For example, you may use Vite's built-in handling to provide images for <meta> tags, display images on your homepage with @sveltejs/enhanced-img, and display user-submitted content with a dynamic approach.\nConsider serving all images via CDN regardless of the image optimization types you use. CDNs reduce latency by distributing copies of static assets globally.\nYour original images should have a good quality/resolution and should have 2x the width it will be displayed at to serve HiDPI devices. Image processing can size images down to save bandwidth when serving smaller screens, but it would be a waste of bandwidth to invent pixels to size images up.\nFor images which are much larger than the width of a mobile device (roughly 400px), such as a hero image taking the width of the page design, specify sizes so that smaller images can be served on smaller devices.\nChoose one image per page which is the most important/largest one and give it priority so it loads faster. This gives you better web vitals scores (largest contentful paint in particular).\nGive the image a container or styling so that it is constrained and does not jump around. width and height help the browser reserving space while the image is still loading. @sveltejs/enhanced-img will add a width and height for you.\nAlways provide a good alt text. The Svelte compiler will warn you if you don't do this.\nPREVIOUS\nServer-only modules\nNEXT\nSnapshots"

SvelteKit handles errors differently depending on where they occur, what kind of errors they are, and the nature of the incoming request.\n\nError objects\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit distinguishes between expected and unexpected errors, both of which are represented as simple { message: string } objects by default.\n\nYou can add additional properties, like a code or a tracking id, as shown in the examples below. (When using TypeScript this requires you to redefine the \nError\n type as described in type safety).\n\nExpected errors\npermalink\n\nAn expected error is one created with the error helper imported from @sveltejs/kit:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server.js\nimport { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';\nimport * as db from '$lib/server/database';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport async function load({ params }) {\n\tconst post = await db.getPost(params.slug);\n\n\n\tif (!post) {\n\t\tthrow error(404, {\n\t\t\tmessage: 'Not found'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\n\treturn { post };\n}\n\nThis tells SvelteKit to set the response status code to 404 and render an +error.svelte component, where $page.error is the object provided as the second argument to error(...).\n\nsrc/routes/+error.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { page } from '$app/stores';\n</script>\n\n<h1>{$page.error.message}</h1>\n\nYou can add extra properties to the error object if needed...\n\nthrow error(404, {\n\tmessage: 'Not found',\n\tcode: 'NOT_FOUND'\n});\n\n\n...otherwise, for convenience, you can pass a string as the second argument:\n\nthrow error(404, { message: 'Not found' });\nthrow error(404, 'Not found');\n\nUnexpected errors\npermalink\n\nAn unexpected error is any other exception that occurs while handling a request. Since these can contain sensitive information, unexpected error messages and stack traces are not exposed to users.\n\nBy default, unexpected errors are printed to the console (or, in production, your server logs), while the error that is exposed to the user has a generic shape:\n\n{ \"message\": \"Internal Error\" }\n\nUnexpected errors will go through the handleError hook, where you can add your own error handling — for example, sending errors to a reporting service, or returning a custom error object.\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\nimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';\n\n\nSentry.init({/*...*/})\n\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').HandleServerError} */\nexport function handleError({ error, event }) {\n\t// example integration with https://sentry.io/\n\tSentry.captureException(error, { extra: { event } });\n\n\n\treturn {\n\t\tmessage: 'Whoops!',\n\t\tcode: error?.code ?? 'UNKNOWN'\n\t};\n}\n\nMake sure that handleError never throws an error\n\nResponses\npermalink\n\nIf an error occurs inside handle or inside a +server.js request handler, SvelteKit will respond with either a fallback error page or a JSON representation of the error object, depending on the request's Accept headers.\n\nYou can customise the fallback error page by adding a src/error.html file:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\t<head>\n\t\t<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n\t\t<title>%sveltekit.error.message%</title>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1>My custom error page</h1>\n\t\t<p>Status: %sveltekit.status%</p>\n\t\t<p>Message: %sveltekit.error.message%</p>\n\t</body>\n</html>\n\nSvelteKit will replace %sveltekit.status% and %sveltekit.error.message% with their corresponding values.\n\nIf the error instead occurs inside a load function while rendering a page, SvelteKit will render the +error.svelte component nearest to where the error occurred. If the error occurs inside a load function in +layout(.server).js, the closest error boundary in the tree is an +error.svelte file above that layout (not next to it).\n\nThe exception is when the error occurs inside the root +layout.js or +layout.server.js, since the root layout would ordinarily contain the +error.svelte component. In this case, SvelteKit uses the fallback error page.\n\nType safety\npermalink\n\nIf you're using TypeScript and need to customize the shape of errors, you can do so by declaring an App.\nError\n interface in your app (by convention, in src/app.d.ts, though it can live anywhere that TypeScript can 'see'):\n\nsrc/app.d.ts\ndeclare global {\n\tnamespace App {\n\t\tinterface Error {\n\t\t\tcode: string;\n\t\t\tid: string;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nexport {};\n\n\nThis interface always includes a message: string property.\n\nFurther reading\npermalink\nTutorial: Errors and redirects\nTutorial: Hooks\nPREVIOUS\nHooks\nNEXT\nLink options"

It receives an event object representing the request and a function called resolve, which renders the route and generates a Response. This allows you to modify response headers or bodies, or bypass SvelteKit entirely (for implementing routes programmatically, for example).\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\tif (event.url.pathname.startsWith('/custom')) {\n\t\treturn new Response('custom response');\n\t}\n\n\n\tconst response = await resolve(event);\n\treturn response;\n}\n\nRequests for static assets — which includes pages that were already prerendered — are not handled by SvelteKit.\n\nIf unimplemented, defaults to ({ event, resolve }) => resolve(event). To add custom data to the request, which is passed to handlers in +server.js and server load functions, populate the event.locals object, as shown below.\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\tevent.locals.user = await getUserInformation(event.cookies.get('sessionid'));\n\n\n\tconst response = await resolve(event);\n\tresponse.headers.set('x-custom-header', 'potato');\n\n\n\treturn response;\n}\n\nYou can define multiple handle functions and execute them with the sequence helper function.\n\nresolve also supports a second, optional parameter that gives you more control over how the response will be rendered. That parameter is an object that can have the following fields:\n\ntransformPageChunk(opts: { html: string, done: boolean }): MaybePromise<string | undefined> — applies custom transforms to HTML. If done is true, it's the final chunk. Chunks are not guaranteed to be well-formed HTML (they could include an element's opening tag but not its closing tag, for example) but they will always be split at sensible boundaries such as %sveltekit.head% or layout/page components.\nfilterSerializedResponseHeaders(name: string, value: string): boolean — determines which headers should be included in serialized responses when a load function loads a resource with fetch. By default, none will be included.\npreload(input: { type: 'js' | 'css' | 'font' | 'asset', path: string }): boolean — determines what files should be added to the <head> tag to preload it. The method is called with each file that was found at build time while constructing the code chunks — so if you for example have import './styles.css in your +page.svelte, preload will be called with the resolved path to that CSS file when visiting that page. Note that in dev mode preload is not called, since it depends on analysis that happens at build time. Preloading can improve performance by downloading assets sooner, but it can also hurt if too much is downloaded unnecessarily. By default, js and css files will be preloaded. asset files are not preloaded at all currently, but we may add this later after evaluating feedback.\nsrc/hooks.server.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\tconst response = await resolve(event, {\n\t\ttransformPageChunk: ({ html }) => html.replace('old', 'new'),\n\t\tfilterSerializedResponseHeaders: (name) => name.startsWith('x-'),\n\t\tpreload: ({ type, path }) => type === 'js' || path.includes('/important/')\n\t});\n\n\n\treturn response;\n}\n\nNote that resolve(...) will never throw an error, it will always return a Promise<Response> with the appropriate status code. If an error is thrown elsewhere during handle, it is treated as fatal, and SvelteKit will respond with a JSON representation of the error or a fallback error page — which can be customised via src/error.html — depending on the Accept header. You can read more about error handling here.\n\nhandleFetch\npermalink\n\nThis function allows you to modify (or replace) a fetch request that happens inside a load or action function that runs on the server (or during pre-rendering).\n\nFor example, your load function might make a request to a public URL like https://api.yourapp.com when the user performs a client-side navigation to the respective page, but during SSR it might make sense to hit the API directly (bypassing whatever proxies and load balancers sit between it and the public internet).\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').HandleFetch} */\nexport async function handleFetch({ request, fetch }) {\n\tif (request.url.startsWith('https://api.yourapp.com/')) {\n\t\t// clone the original request, but change the URL\n\t\trequest = new Request(\n\t\t\trequest.url.replace('https://api.yourapp.com/', 'http://localhost:9999/'),\n\t\t\trequest\n\t\t);\n\t}\n\n\n\treturn fetch(request);\n}\n\nCredentials\n\nFor same-origin requests, SvelteKit's fetch implementation will forward cookie and authorization headers unless the credentials option is set to \"omit\".\n\nFor cross-origin requests, cookie will be included if the request URL belongs to a subdomain of the app — for example if your app is on my-domain.com, and your API is on api.my-domain.com, cookies will be included in the request.\n\nIf your app and your API are on sibling subdomains — www.my-domain.com and api.my-domain.com for example — then a cookie belonging to a common parent domain like my-domain.com will not be included, because SvelteKit has no way to know which domain the cookie belongs to. In these cases you will need to manually include the cookie using handleFetch:\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').HandleFetch} */\nexport async function handleFetch({ event, request, fetch }) {\n\tif (request.url.startsWith('https://api.my-domain.com/')) {\n\t\trequest.headers.set('cookie', event.request.headers.get('cookie'));\n\t}\n\n\n\treturn fetch(request);\n}\nShared hooks\npermalink\n\nThe following can be added to src/hooks.server.js and src/hooks.client.js:\n\nhandleError\npermalink\n\nIf an unexpected error is thrown during loading or rendering, this function will be called with the error and the event. This allows for two things:\n\nyou can log the error\nyou can generate a custom representation of the error that is safe to show to users, omitting sensitive details like messages and stack traces. The returned value becomes the value of $page.error. It defaults to { message: 'Not Found' } in case of a 404 (you can detect them through event.route.id being null) and to { message: 'Internal Error' } for everything else. To make this type-safe, you can customize the expected shape by declaring an App.Error interface (which must include message: string, to guarantee sensible fallback behavior).\n\nThe following code shows an example of typing the error shape as { message: string; errorId: string } and returning it accordingly from the handleError functions:\n\nsrc/app.d.ts\ndeclare global {\n\tnamespace App {\n\t\tinterface Error {\n\t\t\tmessage: string;\n\t\t\terrorId: string;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\nexport {};\nsrc/hooks.server.js\nimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';\nimport crypto from 'crypto';\n\n\nSentry.init({/*...*/})\n\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').HandleServerError} */\nexport async function handleError({ error, event }) {\n\tconst errorId = crypto.randomUUID();\n\t// example integration with https://sentry.io/\n\tSentry.captureException(error, { extra: { event, errorId } });\n\n\n\treturn {\n\t\tmessage: 'Whoops!',\n\t\terrorId\n\t};\n}\nsrc/hooks.client.js\nimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/svelte';\n\n\nSentry.init({/*...*/})\n\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').HandleClientError} */\nexport async function handleError({ error, event }) {\n\tconst errorId = crypto.randomUUID();\n\t// example integration with https://sentry.io/\n\tSentry.captureException(error, { extra: { event, errorId } });\n\n\n\treturn {\n\t\tmessage: 'Whoops!',\n\t\terrorId\n\t};\n}\n\nIn src/hooks.client.js, the type of handleError is \nHandleClientError\n instead of \nHandleServerError\n, and event is a \nNavigationEvent\n rather than a \nRequestEvent\n.\n\nThis function is not called for expected errors (those thrown with the error function imported from @sveltejs/kit).\n\nDuring development, if an error occurs because of a syntax error in your Svelte code, the passed in error has a frame property appended highlighting the location of the error.\n\nMake sure that handleError never throws an error\n\nFurther reading\npermalink\nTutorial: Hooks\nPREVIOUS\nAdvanced routing\nNEXT\nErrors"

Make sure you check that the value of the rest parameter is valid, for example using a matcher.\n\n404 pages\npermalink\n\nRest parameters also allow you to render custom 404s. Given these routes...\n\nsrc/routes/\n├ marx-brothers/\n│ ├ chico/\n│ ├ harpo/\n│ ├ groucho/\n│ └ +error.svelte\n└ +error.svelte\n\n...the marx-brothers/+error.svelte file will not be rendered if you visit /marx-brothers/karl, because no route was matched. If you want to render the nested error page, you should create a route that matches any /marx-brothers/* request, and return a 404 from it:\n\nsrc/routes/\n├ marx-brothers/\n| ├ [...path]/\n│ ├ chico/\n│ ├ harpo/\n│ ├ groucho/\n│ └ +error.svelte\n└ +error.svelte\n\nsrc/routes/marx-brothers/[...path]/+page.js\nimport { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport function load(event) {\n\tthrow error(404, 'Not Found');\n}\n\nIf you don't handle 404 cases, they will appear in handleError\n\nOptional parameters\npermalink\n\nA route like [lang]/home contains a parameter named lang which is required. Sometimes it's beneficial to make these parameters optional, so that in this example both home and en/home point to the same page. You can do that by wrapping the parameter in another bracket pair: [[lang]]/home\n\nNote that an optional route parameter cannot follow a rest parameter ([...rest]/[[optional]]), since parameters are matched 'greedily' and the optional parameter would always be unused.\n\nMatching\npermalink\n\nA route like src/routes/archive/[page] would match /archive/3, but it would also match /archive/potato. We don't want that. You can ensure that route parameters are well-formed by adding a matcher — which takes the parameter string (\"3\" or \"potato\") and returns true if it is valid — to your params directory...\n\nsrc/params/integer.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').ParamMatcher} */\nexport function match(param) {\n\treturn /^\\d+$/.test(param);\n}\n\n...and augmenting your routes:\n\nsrc/routes/archive/[page]\nsrc/routes/archive/[page=integer]\n\n\nIf the pathname doesn't match, SvelteKit will try to match other routes (using the sort order specified below), before eventually returning a 404.\n\nEach module in the params directory corresponds to a matcher, with the exception of *.test.js and *.spec.js files which may be used to unit test your matchers.\n\nMatchers run both on the server and in the browser.\n\nSorting\npermalink\n\nIt's possible for multiple routes to match a given path. For example each of these routes would match /foo-abc:\n\nsrc/routes/[...catchall]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/[[a=x]]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/[b]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte\n\nSvelteKit needs to know which route is being requested. To do so, it sorts them according to the following rules...\n\nMore specific routes are higher priority (e.g. a route with no parameters is more specific than a route with one dynamic parameter, and so on)\nParameters with matchers ([name=type]) are higher priority than those without ([name])\n[[optional]] and [...rest] parameters are ignored unless they are the final part of the route, in which case they are treated with lowest priority. In other words x/[[y]]/z is treated equivalently to x/z for the purposes of sorting\nTies are resolved alphabetically\n\n...resulting in this ordering, meaning that /foo-abc will invoke src/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte, and /foo-def will invoke src/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte rather than less specific routes:\n\nsrc/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/[[a=x]]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/[b]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/[...catchall]/+page.svelte\nEncoding\npermalink\n\nSome characters can't be used on the filesystem — / on Linux and Mac, \\ / : * ? \" < > | on Windows. The # and % characters have special meaning in URLs, and the [ ] ( ) characters have special meaning to SvelteKit, so these also can't be used directly as part of your route.\n\nTo use these characters in your routes, you can use hexadecimal escape sequences, which have the format [x+nn] where nn is a hexadecimal character code:\n\n\\ — [x+5c]\n/ — [x+2f]\n: — [x+3a]\n* — [x+2a]\n? — [x+3f]\n\" — [x+22]\n< — [x+3c]\n> — [x+3e]\n| — [x+7c]\n# — [x+23]\n% — [x+25]\n[ — [x+5b]\n] — [x+5d]\n( — [x+28]\n) — [x+29]\n\nFor example, to create a /smileys/:-) route, you would create a src/routes/smileys/[x+3a]-[x+29]/+page.svelte file.\n\nYou can determine the hexadecimal code for a character with JavaScript:\n\n':'.charCodeAt(0).toString(16); // '3a', hence '[x+3a]'\n\nYou can also use Unicode escape sequences. Generally you won't need to as you can use the unencoded character directly, but if — for some reason — you can't have a filename with an emoji in it, for example, then you can use the escaped characters. In other words, these are equivalent:\n\nsrc/routes/[u+d83e][u+dd2a]/+page.svelte\nsrc/routes/🤪/+page.svelte\n\nThe format for a Unicode escape sequence is [u+nnnn] where nnnn is a valid value between 0000 and 10ffff. (Unlike JavaScript string escaping, there's no need to use surrogate pairs to represent code points above ffff.) To learn more about Unicode encodings, consult Programming with Unicode.\n\nSince TypeScript struggles with directories with a leading . character, you may find it useful to encode these characters when creating e.g. .well-known routes: src/routes/[x+2e]well-known/...\n\nAdvanced layouts\npermalink\n\nBy default, the layout hierarchy mirrors the route hierarchy. In some cases, that might not be what you want.\n\n(group)\npermalink\n\nPerhaps you have some routes that are 'app' routes that should have one layout (e.g. /dashboard or /item), and others that are 'marketing' routes that should have a different layout (/about or /testimonials). We can group these routes with a directory whose name is wrapped in parentheses — unlike normal directories, (app) and (marketing) do not affect the URL pathname of the routes inside them:\n\nsrc/routes/\n│ (app)/\n│ ├ dashboard/\n│ ├ item/\n│ └ +layout.svelte\n│ (marketing)/\n│ ├ about/\n│ ├ testimonials/\n│ └ +layout.svelte\n├ admin/\n└ +layout.svelte\n\n\nYou can also put a +page directly inside a (group), for example if / should be an (app) or a (marketing) page.\n\nBreaking out of layouts\npermalink\n\nThe root layout applies to every page of your app — if omitted, it defaults to <slot />. If you want some pages to have a different layout hierarchy than the rest, then you can put your entire app inside one or more groups except the routes that should not inherit the common layouts.\n\nIn the example above, the /admin route does not inherit either the (app) or (marketing) layouts.\n\n+page@\npermalink\n\nPages can break out of the current layout hierarchy on a route-by-route basis. Suppose we have an /item/[id]/embed route inside the (app) group from the previous example:\n\nsrc/routes/\n├ (app)/\n│ ├ item/\n│ │ ├ [id]/\n│ │ │ ├ embed/\n│ │ │ │ └ +page.svelte\n│ │ │ └ +layout.svelte\n│ │ └ +layout.svelte\n│ └ +layout.svelte\n└ +layout.svelte\n\n\nOrdinarily, this would inherit the root layout, the (app) layout, the item layout and the [id] layout. We can reset to one of those layouts by appending @ followed by the segment name — or, for the root layout, the empty string. In this example, we can choose from the following options:\n\n+page@[id].svelte - inherits from src/routes/(app)/item/[id]/+layout.svelte\n+page@item.svelte - inherits from src/routes/(app)/item/+layout.svelte\n+page@(app).svelte - inherits from src/routes/(app)/+layout.svelte\n+page@.svelte - inherits from src/routes/+layout.svelte\nsrc/routes/\n├ (app)/\n│ ├ item/\n│ │ ├ [id]/\n│ │ │ ├ embed/\n│ │ │ │ └ +page@(app).svelte\n│ │ │ └ +layout.svelte\n│ │ └ +layout.svelte\n│ └ +layout.svelte\n└ +layout.svelte\n\n+layout@\npermalink\n\nLike pages, layouts can themselves break out of their parent layout hierarchy, using the same technique. For example, a +layout@.svelte component would reset the hierarchy for all its child routes.\n\nsrc/routes/\n├ (app)/\n│ ├ item/\n│ │ ├ [id]/\n│ │ │ ├ embed/\n│ │ │ │ └ +page.svelte  // uses (app)/item/[id]/+layout.svelte\n│ │ │ ├ +layout.svelte  // inherits from (app)/item/+layout@.svelte\n│ │ │ └ +page.svelte    // uses (app)/item/+layout@.svelte\n│ │ └ +layout@.svelte   // inherits from root layout, skipping (app)/+layout.svelte\n│ └ +layout.svelte\n└ +layout.svelte\nWhen to use layout groups\npermalink\n\nNot all use cases are suited for layout grouping, nor should you feel compelled to use them. It might be that your use case would result in complex (group) nesting, or that you don't want to introduce a (group) for a single outlier. It's perfectly fine to use other means such as composition (reusable load functions or Svelte components) or if-statements to achieve what you want. The following example shows a layout that rewinds to the root layout and reuses components and functions that other layouts can also use:\n\nsrc/routes/nested/route/+layout@.svelte\n<script>\n\timport ReusableLayout from '$lib/ReusableLayout.svelte';\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<ReusableLayout {data}>\n\t<slot />\n</ReusableLayout>\nsrc/routes/nested/route/+layout.js\nimport { reusableLoad } from '$lib/reusable-load-function';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport function load(event) {\n\t// Add additional logic here, if needed\n\treturn reusableLoad(event);\n}\nFurther reading\npermalink\nTutorial: Advanced Routing\nPREVIOUS\nWriting adapters\nNEXT\nHooks"

Like other environment variables, these are accessible from $env/static/private and $env/dynamic/private (sometimes — more on that later), and inaccessible from their public counterparts. To access one of these variables from the client:\n\n+layout.server.js\nimport { VERCEL_COMMIT_REF } from '$env/static/private';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerLoad} */\nexport function load() {\n\treturn {\n\t\tdeploymentGitBranch: VERCEL_COMMIT_REF\n\t};\n}\n+layout.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<p>This staging environment was deployed from {data.deploymentGitBranch}.</p>\n\nSince all of these variables are unchanged between build time and run time when building on Vercel, we recommend using $env/static/private — which will statically replace the variables, enabling optimisations like dead code elimination — rather than $env/dynamic/private.\n\nNotes\npermalink\nVercel functions\npermalink\n\nIf you have Vercel functions contained in the api directory at the project's root, any requests for /api/* will not be handled by SvelteKit. You should implement these as API routes in your SvelteKit app instead, unless you need to use a non-JavaScript language in which case you will need to ensure that you don't have any /api/* routes in your SvelteKit app.\n\nNode version\npermalink\n\nProjects created before a certain date will default to using Node 14, while SvelteKit requires Node 16 or later. You can change the Node version in your project settings.\n\nTroubleshooting\npermalink\nAccessing the file system\npermalink\n\nYou can't access the file system through methods like fs.readFileSync in Serverless/Edge environments. If you need to access files that way, do that during building the app through prerendering.

This will determine where to write static assets based on the build.publish settings, as per this sample configuration:\n\n[build]\n\tcommand = \"npm run build\"\n\tpublish = \"build\"\n\nIf the netlify.toml file or the build.publish value is missing, a default value of \"build\" will be used. Note that if you have set the publish directory in the Netlify UI to something else then you will need to set it in netlify.toml too, or use the default value of \"build\".\n\nNode version\npermalink\n\nNew projects will use Node 16 by default. However, if you're upgrading a project you created a while ago it may be stuck on an older version. See the Netlify docs for details on manually specifying Node 16 or newer.\n\nNetlify Edge Functions\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit supports Netlify Edge Functions. If you pass the option edge: true to the adapter function, server-side rendering will happen in a Deno-based edge function that's deployed close to the site visitor. If set to false (the default), the site will deploy to Node-based Netlify Functions.\n\nsvelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';\n\n\nexport default {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tadapter: adapter({\n\t\t\t// will create a Netlify Edge Function using Deno-based\n\t\t\t// rather than using standard Node-based functions\n\t\t\tedge: true\n\t\t})\n\t}\n};\nNetlify alternatives to SvelteKit functionality\npermalink\n\nYou may build your app using functionality provided directly by SvelteKit without relying on any Netlify functionality. Using the SvelteKit versions of these features will allow them to be used in dev mode, tested with integration tests, and to work with other adapters should you ever decide to switch away from Netlify. However, in some scenarios you may find it beneficial to use the Netlify versions of these features. One example would be if you're migrating an app that's already hosted on Netlify to SvelteKit.\n\nRedirect rules\npermalink\n\nDuring compilation, redirect rules are automatically appended to your _redirects file. (If it doesn't exist yet, it will be created.) That means:\n\n[[redirects]] in netlify.toml will never match as _redirects has a higher priority. So always put your rules in the _redirects file.\n_redirects shouldn't have any custom \"catch all\" rules such as /* /foobar/:splat. Otherwise the automatically appended rule will never be applied as Netlify is only processing the first matching rule.\nNetlify Forms\npermalink\nCreate your Netlify HTML form as described here, e.g. as /routes/contact/+page.svelte. (Don't forget to add the hidden form-name input element!)\nNetlify's build bot parses your HTML files at deploy time, which means your form must be prerendered as HTML. You can either add export const prerender = true to your contact.svelte to prerender just that page or set the kit.prerender.force: true option to prerender all pages.\nIf your Netlify form has a custom success message like <form netlify ... action=\"/success\"> then ensure the corresponding /routes/success/+page.svelte exists and is prerendered.\nNetlify Functions\npermalink\n\nWith this adapter, SvelteKit endpoints are hosted as Netlify Functions. Netlify function handlers have additional context, including Netlify Identity information. You can access this context via the event.platform.context field inside your hooks and +page.server or +layout.server endpoints. These are serverless functions when the edge property is false in the adapter config or edge functions when it is true.\n\n+page.server.js\nexport const load = async (event) => {\n\tconst context = event.platform.context;\n\tconsole.log(context); // shows up in your functions log in the Netlify app\n};\n\nAdditionally, you can add your own Netlify functions by creating a directory for them and adding the configuration to your netlify.toml file. For example:\n\n[build]\n\tcommand = \"npm run build\"\n\tpublish = \"build\"\n\n[functions]\n\tdirectory = \"functions\"\nTroubleshooting\npermalink\nAccessing the file system\npermalink\n\nYou can't access the file system through methods like fs.readFileSync in Serverless/Edge environments. If you need to access files that way, do that during building the app through prerendering. If you have a blog for example and don't want to manage your content through a CMS, then you need to prerender the content (or prerender the endpoint from which you get it) and redeploy your blog everytime you add new content.\n\nPREVIOUS\nCloudflare Workers\nNEXT\nVercel"

It should look something like this:\n\nwrangler.toml\nname = \"<your-service-name>\"\naccount_id = \"<your-account-id>\"\n\nmain = \"./.cloudflare/worker.js\"\nsite.bucket = \"./.cloudflare/public\"\n\nbuild.command = \"npm run build\"\n\ncompatibility_date = \"2021-11-12\"\nworkers_dev = true\n\n<your-service-name> can be anything. <your-account-id> can be found by logging into your Cloudflare dashboard and grabbing it from the end of the URL:\n\nhttps://dash.cloudflare.com/<your-account-id>\n\nYou should add the .cloudflare directory (or whichever directories you specified for main and site.bucket) to your .gitignore.\n\nYou will need to install wrangler and log in, if you haven't already:\n\nnpm i -g wrangler\nwrangler login\n\nThen, you can build your app and deploy it:\n\nwrangler publish\nCustom config\npermalink\n\nIf you would like to use a config file other than wrangler.toml, you can do like so:\n\nsvelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers';\n\n\nexport default {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tadapter: adapter({ config: '<your-wrangler-name>.toml' })\n\t}\n};\nBindings\npermalink\n\nThe env object contains your project's bindings, which consist of KV/DO namespaces, etc. It is passed to SvelteKit via the platform property, along with context and caches, meaning that you can access it in hooks and endpoints:\n\nexport async function POST({ request, platform }) {\n\tconst x = platform.env.YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromName('x');\n}\n\nSvelteKit's built-in $env module should be preferred for environment variables.\n\nTo make these types available to your app, reference them in your src/app.d.ts:\n\nsrc/app.d.ts\ndeclare global {\n\tnamespace App {\n\t\tinterface Platform {\n\t\t\tenv?: {\n\t\t\t\tYOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;\n\t\t\t\tYOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE: DurableObjectNamespace;\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nexport {};\n\nTesting Locally\npermalink\n\nplatform.env is only available in the final build and not in dev mode. For testing the build, you can use wrangler. Once you have built your site, run wrangler dev. Ensure you have your bindings in your wrangler.toml. Wrangler version 3 is recommended.\n\nTroubleshooting\npermalink\nWorker size limits\npermalink\n\nWhen deploying to workers, the server generated by SvelteKit is bundled into a single file. Wrangler will fail to publish your worker if it exceeds the size limits after minification. You're unlikely to hit this limit usually, but some large libraries can cause this to happen. In that case, you can try to reduce the size of your worker by only importing such libraries on the client side. See the FAQ for more information.\n\nAccessing the file system\npermalink\n\nYou can't access the file system through methods like fs.readFileSync in Serverless/Edge environments. If you need to access files that way, do that during building the app through prerendering. If you have a blog for example and don't want to manage your content through a CMS, then you need to prerender the content (or prerender the endpoint from which you get it) and redeploy your blog everytime you add new content.\n\nPREVIOUS\nCloudflare Pages\nNEXT\nNetlify"

This check exists to prevent you from accidentally publishing an app where some parts of it are not accessible, because they are not contained in the final output. If you know this is ok (for example when a certain page only exists conditionally), you can set strict to false to turn off this check.\n\nGitHub Pages\npermalink\n\nWhen building for GitHub Pages, if your repo name is not equivalent to your-username.github.io, make sure to update config.kit.paths.base to match your repo name.

This will create the production server in the output directory specified in the adapter options, defaulting to build.\n\nYou will need the output directory, the project's package.json, and the production dependencies in node_modules to run the application. Production dependencies can be generated by copying the package.json and package-lock.json and then running npm ci --omit dev (you can skip this step if your app doesn't have any dependencies). You can then start your app with this command:\n\nnode build\n\nDevelopment dependencies will be bundled into your app using Rollup. To control whether a given package is bundled or externalised, place it in devDependencies or dependencies respectively in your package.json.\n\nEnvironment variables\npermalink\n\nIn dev and preview, SvelteKit will read environment variables from your .env file (or .env.local, or .env.[mode], as determined by Vite.)\n\nIn production, .env files are not automatically loaded. To do so, install dotenv in your project...\n\nnpm install dotenv\n\n...and invoke it before running the built app:\n\nnode build\nnode -r dotenv/config build\n\nPORT, HOST and SOCKET_PATH\npermalink\n\nBy default, the server will accept connections on 0.0.0.0 using port 3000. These can be customised with the PORT and HOST environment variables:\n\nHOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=4000 node build\n\nAlternatively, the server can be configured to accept connections on a specified socket path. When this is done using the SOCKET_PATH environment variable, the HOST and PORT environment variables will be disregarded.\n\nSOCKET_PATH=/tmp/socket node build\nORIGIN, PROTOCOL_HEADER and HOST_HEADER\npermalink\n\nHTTP doesn't give SvelteKit a reliable way to know the URL that is currently being requested. The simplest way to tell SvelteKit where the app is being served is to set the ORIGIN environment variable:\n\nORIGIN=https://my.site node build\n\n# or e.g. for local previewing and testing\nORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 node build\n\nWith this, a request for the /stuff pathname will correctly resolve to https://my.site/stuff. Alternatively, you can specify headers that tell SvelteKit about the request protocol and host, from which it can construct the origin URL:\n\nPROTOCOL_HEADER=x-forwarded-proto HOST_HEADER=x-forwarded-host node build\n\nx-forwarded-proto and x-forwarded-host are de facto standard headers that forward the original protocol and host if you're using a reverse proxy (think load balancers and CDNs). You should only set these variables if your server is behind a trusted reverse proxy; otherwise, it'd be possible for clients to spoof these headers.\n\nIf adapter-node can't correctly determine the URL of your deployment, you may experience this error when using form actions:\n\nCross-site POST form submissions are forbidden\n\nADDRESS_HEADER and XFF_DEPTH\npermalink\n\nThe RequestEvent object passed to hooks and endpoints includes an event.getClientAddress() function that returns the client's IP address. By default this is the connecting remoteAddress. If your server is behind one or more proxies (such as a load balancer), this value will contain the innermost proxy's IP address rather than the client's, so we need to specify an ADDRESS_HEADER to read the address from:\n\nADDRESS_HEADER=True-Client-IP node build\n\nHeaders can easily be spoofed. As with PROTOCOL_HEADER and HOST_HEADER, you should know what you're doing before setting these.\n\nIf the ADDRESS_HEADER is X-Forwarded-For, the header value will contain a comma-separated list of IP addresses. The XFF_DEPTH environment variable should specify how many trusted proxies sit in front of your server. E.g. if there are three trusted proxies, proxy 3 will forward the addresses of the original connection and the first two proxies:\n\n<client address>, <proxy 1 address>, <proxy 2 address>\n\nSome guides will tell you to read the left-most address, but this leaves you vulnerable to spoofing:\n\n<spoofed address>, <client address>, <proxy 1 address>, <proxy 2 address>\n\nWe instead read from the right, accounting for the number of trusted proxies. In this case, we would use XFF_DEPTH=3.\n\nIf you need to read the left-most address instead (and don't care about spoofing) — for example, to offer a geolocation service, where it's more important for the IP address to be real than trusted, you can do so by inspecting the x-forwarded-for header within your app.\n\nBODY_SIZE_LIMIT\npermalink\n\nThe maximum request body size to accept in bytes including while streaming. Defaults to 512kb. You can disable this option with a value of 0 and implement a custom check in handle if you need something more advanced.\n\nOptions\npermalink\n\nThe adapter can be configured with various options:\n\nsvelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\n\n\nexport default {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tadapter: adapter({\n\t\t\t// default options are shown\n\t\t\tout: 'build',\n\t\t\tprecompress: false,\n\t\t\tenvPrefix: '',\n\t\t\tpolyfill: true\n\t\t})\n\t}\n};\nout\npermalink\n\nThe directory to build the server to. It defaults to build — i.e. node build would start the server locally after it has been created.\n\nprecompress\npermalink\n\nEnables precompressing using gzip and brotli for assets and prerendered pages. It defaults to false.\n\nenvPrefix\npermalink\n\nIf you need to change the name of the environment variables used to configure the deployment (for example, to deconflict with environment variables you don't control), you can specify a prefix:\n\nenvPrefix: 'MY_CUSTOM_';\nMY_CUSTOM_HOST=127.0.0.1 \\\nMY_CUSTOM_PORT=4000 \\\nMY_CUSTOM_ORIGIN=https://my.site \\\nnode build\npolyfill\npermalink\n\nControls whether your build will load polyfills for missing modules. It defaults to true, and should only be disabled when using Node 18.11 or greater.\n\nNote: to use Node's built-in crypto global with Node 18 you will need to use the --experimental-global-webcrypto flag. This flag is not required with Node 20.\n\nCustom server\npermalink\n\nThe adapter creates two files in your build directory — index.js and handler.js. Running index.js — e.g. node build, if you use the default build directory — will start a server on the configured port.\n\nAlternatively, you can import the handler.js file, which exports a handler suitable for use with Express, Connect or Polka (or even just the built-in http.createServer) and set up your own server:\n\nmy-server.js\nimport { handler } from './build/handler.js';\nimport express from 'express';\n\n\nconst app = express();\n\n\n// add a route that lives separately from the SvelteKit app\napp.get('/healthcheck', (req, res) => {\n\tres.end('ok');\n});\n\n\n// let SvelteKit handle everything else, including serving prerendered pages and static assets\napp.use(handler);\n\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n\tconsole.log('listening on port 3000');\n});\nTroubleshooting\npermalink\nIs there a hook for cleaning up before the server exits?\npermalink\n\nThere's nothing built-in to SvelteKit for this, because such a cleanup hook depends highly on the execution environment you're on. For Node, you can use its built-in process.on(..) to implement a callback that runs before the server exits:\n\nfunction shutdownGracefully() {\n\t// anything you need to clean up manually goes in here\n\tdb.shutdown();\n}\n\n\nprocess.on('SIGINT', shutdownGracefully);\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', shutdownGracefully);\nPREVIOUS\nZero-config deployments\nNEXT\nStatic site generation"

    "html": "CORE CONCEPTS\n\nForm actions\nForm actions\nDefault actions\nNamed actions\nAnatomy of an action\nLoading data\nProgressive enhancement\nAlternatives\nGET vs POST\nFurther reading\n\nA +page.server.js file can export actions, which allow you to POST data to the server using the <form> element.\n\nWhen using <form>, client-side JavaScript is optional, but you can easily progressively enhance your form interactions with JavaScript to provide the best user experience.\n\nDefault actions\npermalink\n\nIn the simplest case, a page declares a default action:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tdefault: async (event) => {\n\t\t// TODO log the user in\n\t}\n};\n\nTo invoke this action from the /login page, just add a <form> — no JavaScript needed:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<form method=\"POST\">\n\t<label>\n\t\tEmail\n\t\t<input name=\"email\" type=\"email\">\n\t</label>\n\t<label>\n\t\tPassword\n\t\t<input name=\"password\" type=\"password\">\n\t</label>\n\t<button>Log in</button>\n</form>\n\nIf someone were to click the button, the browser would send the form data via POST request to the server, running the default action.\n\nActions always use POST requests, since GET requests should never have side-effects.\n\nWe can also invoke the action from other pages (for example if there's a login widget in the nav in the root layout) by adding the action attribute, pointing to the page:\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.svelte\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/login\">\n\t<!-- content -->\n</form>\nNamed actions\npermalink\n\nInstead of one default action, a page can have as many named actions as it needs:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tdefault: async (event) => {\n\tlogin: async (event) => {\n\t\t// TODO log the user in\n\t},\n\tregister: async (event) => {\n\t\t// TODO register the user\n\t}\n};\n\n\nTo invoke a named action, add a query parameter with the name prefixed by a / character:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"?/register\">\nsrc/routes/+layout.svelte\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/login?/register\">\n\nAs well as the action attribute, we can use the formaction attribute on a button to POST the same form data to a different action than the parent <form>:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<form method=\"POST\">\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"?/login\">\n\t<label>\n\t\tEmail\n\t\t<input name=\"email\" type=\"email\">\n\t</label>\n\t<label>\n\t\tPassword\n\t\t<input name=\"password\" type=\"password\">\n\t</label>\n\t<button>Log in</button>\n\t<button formaction=\"?/register\">Register</button>\n</form>\n\n\nWe can't have default actions next to named actions, because if you POST to a named action without a redirect, the query parameter is persisted in the URL, which means the next default POST would go through the named action from before.\n\nAnatomy of an action\npermalink\n\nEach action receives a \nRequestEvent\n object, allowing you to read the data with request.formData(). After processing the request (for example, logging the user in by setting a cookie), the action can respond with data that will be available through the form property on the corresponding page and through $page.form app-wide until the next update.\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport async function load({ cookies }) {\n\tconst user = await db.getUserFromSession(cookies.get('sessionid'));\n\treturn { user };\n}\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tlogin: async ({ cookies, request }) => {\n\t\tconst data = await request.formData();\n\t\tconst email = data.get('email');\n\t\tconst password = data.get('password');\n\n\n\t\tconst user = await db.getUser(email);\n\t\tcookies.set('sessionid', await db.createSession(user));\n\n\n\t\treturn { success: true };\n\t},\n\tregister: async (event) => {\n\t\t// TODO register the user\n\t}\n};\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').ActionData} */\n\texport let form;\n</script>\n\n{#if form?.success}\n\t<!-- this message is ephemeral; it exists because the page was rendered in\n\t\t   response to a form submission. it will vanish if the user reloads -->\n\t<p>Successfully logged in! Welcome back, {data.user.name}</p>\n{/if}\nValidation errors\npermalink\n\nIf the request couldn't be processed because of invalid data, you can return validation errors — along with the previously submitted form values — back to the user so that they can try again. The fail function lets you return an HTTP status code (typically 400 or 422, in the case of validation errors) along with the data. The status code is available through $page.status and the data through form:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.server.js\nimport { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tlogin: async ({ cookies, request }) => {\n\t\tconst data = await request.formData();\n\t\tconst email = data.get('email');\n\t\tconst password = data.get('password');\n\n\t\tif (!email) {\n\t\t\treturn fail(400, { email, missing: true });\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tconst user = await db.getUser(email);\n\n\t\tif (!user || user.password !== hash(password)) {\n\t\t\treturn fail(400, { email, incorrect: true });\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tcookies.set('sessionid', await db.createSession(user));\n\n\t\treturn { success: true };\n\t},\n\tregister: async (event) => {\n\t\t// TODO register the user\n\t}\n};\n\n\nNote that as a precaution, we only return the email back to the page — not the password.\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"?/login\">\n\t{#if form?.missing}<p class=\"error\">The email field is required</p>{/if}\n\t{#if form?.incorrect}<p class=\"error\">Invalid credentials!</p>{/if}\n\t<label>\n\t\tEmail\n\t\t<input name=\"email\" type=\"email\">\n\t\t<input name=\"email\" type=\"email\" value={form?.email ?? ''}>\n\t</label>\n\t<label>\n\t\tPassword\n\t\t<input name=\"password\" type=\"password\">\n\t</label>\n\t<button>Log in</button>\n\t<button formaction=\"?/register\">Register</button>\n</form>\n\n\nThe returned data must be serializable as JSON. Beyond that, the structure is entirely up to you. For example, if you had multiple forms on the page, you could distinguish which <form> the returned form data referred to with an id property or similar.\n\nRedirects\npermalink\n\nRedirects (and errors) work exactly the same as in load:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.server.js\nimport { fail, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tlogin: async ({ cookies, request, url }) => {\n\t\tconst data = await request.formData();\n\t\tconst email = data.get('email');\n\t\tconst password = data.get('password');\n\n\t\tconst user = await db.getUser(email);\n\t\tif (!user) {\n\t\t\treturn fail(400, { email, missing: true });\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif (user.password !== hash(password)) {\n\t\t\treturn fail(400, { email, incorrect: true });\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tcookies.set('sessionid', await db.createSession(user));\n\n\t\tif (url.searchParams.has('redirectTo')) {\n\t\t\tthrow redirect(303, url.searchParams.get('redirectTo'));\n\t\t}\n\n\t\treturn { success: true };\n\t},\n\tregister: async (event) => {\n\t\t// TODO register the user\n\t}\n};\n\nLoading data\npermalink\n\nAfter an action runs, the page will be re-rendered (unless a redirect or an unexpected error occurs), with the action's return value available to the page as the form prop. This means that your page's load functions will run after the action completes.\n\nNote that handle runs before the action is invoked, and does not rerun before the load functions. This means that if, for example, you use handle to populate event.locals based on a cookie, you must update event.locals when you set or delete the cookie in an action:\n\nsrc/hooks.server.js\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\n\tevent.locals.user = await getUser(event.cookies.get('sessionid'));\n\treturn resolve(event);\n}\nsrc/routes/account/+page.server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport function load(event) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tuser: event.locals.user\n\t};\n}\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tlogout: async (event) => {\n\t\tevent.cookies.delete('sessionid');\n\t\tevent.locals.user = null;\n\t}\n};\nProgressive enhancement\npermalink\n\nIn the preceding sections we built a /login action that works without client-side JavaScript — not a fetch in sight. That's great, but when JavaScript is available we can progressively enhance our form interactions to provide a better user experience.\n\nuse:enhance\npermalink\n\nThe easiest way to progressively enhance a form is to add the use:enhance action:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { enhance } from '$app/forms';\n\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').ActionData} */\n\texport let form;\n</script>\n\n<form method=\"POST\" use:enhance>\n\n\nYes, it's a little confusing that the enhance action and <form action> are both called 'action'. These docs are action-packed. Sorry.\n\nWithout an argument, use:enhance will emulate the browser-native behaviour, just without the full-page reloads. It will:\n\nupdate the form property, $page.form and $page.status on a successful or invalid response, but only if the action is on the same page you're submitting from. For example, if your form looks like <form action=\"/somewhere/else\" ..>, form and $page will not be updated. This is because in the native form submission case you would be redirected to the page the action is on. If you want to have them updated either way, use applyAction\nreset the <form> element\ninvalidate all data using invalidateAll on a successful response\ncall goto on a redirect response\nrender the nearest +error boundary if an error occurs\nreset focus to the appropriate element\nCustomising use:enhance\npermalink\n\nTo customise the behaviour, you can provide a \nSubmitFunction\n that runs immediately before the form is submitted, and (optionally) returns a callback that runs with the \nActionResult\n. Note that if you return a callback, the default behavior mentioned above is not triggered. To get it back, call update.\n\n<form\n\tmethod=\"POST\"\n\tuse:enhance={({ formElement, formData, action, cancel, submitter }) => {\n\t\t// `formElement` is this `<form>` element\n\t\t// `formData` is its `FormData` object that's about to be submitted\n\t\t// `action` is the URL to which the form is posted\n\t\t// calling `cancel()` will prevent the submission\n\t\t// `submitter` is the `HTMLElement` that caused the form to be submitted\n\n\t\treturn async ({ result, update }) => {\n\t\t\t// `result` is an `ActionResult` object\n\t\t\t// `update` is a function which triggers the default logic that would be triggered if this callback wasn't set\n\t\t};\n\t}}\n>\n\nYou can use these functions to show and hide loading UI, and so on.\n\nIf you return a callback, you may need to reproduce part of the default use:enhance behaviour, but without invalidating all data on a successful response. You can do so with applyAction:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { enhance, applyAction } from '$app/forms';\n\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').ActionData} */\n\texport let form;\n</script>\n\n<form\n\tmethod=\"POST\"\n\tuse:enhance={({ formElement, formData, action, cancel }) => {\n\n\t\treturn async ({ result }) => {\n\t\t\t// `result` is an `ActionResult` object\n\t\t\tif (result.type === 'redirect') {\n\t\t\t\tgoto(result.location);\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\tawait applyAction(result);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t};\n\t}}\n>\n\n\nThe behaviour of applyAction(result) depends on result.type:\n\nsuccess, failure — sets $page.status to result.status and updates form and $page.form to result.data (regardless of where you are submitting from, in contrast to update from enhance)\nredirect — calls goto(result.location, { invalidateAll: true })\nerror — renders the nearest +error boundary with result.error\n\nIn all cases, focus will be reset.\n\nCustom event listener\npermalink\n\nWe can also implement progressive enhancement ourselves, without use:enhance, with a normal event listener on the <form>:\n\nsrc/routes/login/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { invalidateAll, goto } from '$app/navigation';\n\timport { applyAction, deserialize } from '$app/forms';\n\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').ActionData} */\n\texport let form;\n\n\t/** @type {any} */\n\tlet error;\n\n\t/** @param {{ currentTarget: EventTarget & HTMLFormElement}} event */\n\tasync function handleSubmit(event) {\n\t\tconst data = new FormData(event.currentTarget);\n\n\t\tconst response = await fetch(event.currentTarget.action, {\n\t\t\tmethod: 'POST',\n\t\t\tbody: data\n\t\t});\n\n\t\t/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').ActionResult} */\n\t\tconst result = deserialize(await response.text());\n\n\t\tif (result.type === 'success') {\n\t\t\t// rerun all `load` functions, following the successful update\n\t\t\tawait invalidateAll();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tapplyAction(result);\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<form method=\"POST\" on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>\n\t<!-- content -->\n</form>\n\nNote that you need to deserialize the response before processing it further using the corresponding method from $app/forms. JSON.parse() isn't enough because form actions - like load functions - also support returning Date or BigInt objects.\n\nIf you have a +server.js alongside your +page.server.js, fetch requests will be routed there by default. To POST to an action in +page.server.js instead, use the custom x-sveltekit-action header:\n\nconst response = await fetch(this.action, {\n\tmethod: 'POST',\n\tbody: data,\n\theaders: {\n\t\t'x-sveltekit-action': 'true'\n\t}\n});\n\nAlternatives\npermalink\n\nForm actions are the preferred way to send data to the server, since they can be progressively enhanced, but you can also use +server.js files to expose (for example) a JSON API. Here's how such an interaction could look like:\n\nsend-message/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\tfunction rerun() {\n\t\tfetch('/api/ci', {\n\t\t\tmethod: 'POST'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<button on:click={rerun}>Rerun CI</button>\napi/ci/+server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport function POST() {\n\t// do something\n}\nGET vs POST\npermalink\n\nAs we've seen, to invoke a form action you must use method=\"POST\".\n\nSome forms don't need to POST data to the server — search inputs, for example. For these you can use method=\"GET\" (or, equivalently, no method at all), and SvelteKit will treat them like <a> elements, using the client-side router instead of a full page navigation:\n\n<form action=\"/search\">\n\t<label>\n\t\tSearch\n\t\t<input name=\"q\">\n\t</label>\n</form>\n\nSubmitting this form will navigate to /search?q=... and invoke your load function but will not invoke an action. As with <a> elements, you can set the data-sveltekit-reload, data-sveltekit-replacestate, data-sveltekit-keepfocus and data-sveltekit-noscroll attributes on the <form> to control the router's behaviour.\n\nFurther reading\npermalink\nTutorial: Forms\nPREVIOUS\nLoading data\nNEXT\nPage options"

    "html": "CORE CONCEPTS\n\nState management\nState management\nAvoid shared state on the server\nNo side-effects in load\nUsing stores with context\nComponent state is preserved\nStoring state in the URL\nStoring ephemeral state in snapshots\n\nIf you're used to building client-only apps, state management in an app that spans server and client might seem intimidating. This section provides tips for avoiding some common gotchas.\n\nAvoid shared state on the server\npermalink\n\nBrowsers are stateful — state is stored in memory as the user interacts with the application. Servers, on the other hand, are stateless — the content of the response is determined entirely by the content of the request.\n\nConceptually, that is. In reality, servers are often long-lived and shared by multiple users. For that reason it's important not to store data in shared variables. For example, consider this code:\n\n+page.server.js\nlet user;\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport function load() {\n\treturn { user };\n}\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tdefault: async ({ request }) => {\n\t\tconst data = await request.formData();\n\n\n\t\t// NEVER DO THIS!\n\t\tuser = {\n\t\t\tname: data.get('name'),\n\t\t\tembarrassingSecret: data.get('secret')\n\t\t};\n\t}\n}\n\nThe user variable is shared by everyone who connects to this server. If Alice submitted an embarrassing secret, and Bob visited the page after her, Bob would know Alice's secret. In addition, when Alice returns to the site later in the day, the server may have restarted, losing her data.\n\nInstead, you should authenticate the user using cookies and persist the data to a database.\n\nNo side-effects in load\npermalink\n\nFor the same reason, your load functions should be pure — no side-effects (except maybe the occasional console.log(...)). For example, you might be tempted to write to a store inside a load function so that you can use the store value in your components:\n\n+page.js\nimport { user } from '$lib/user';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport async function load({ fetch }) {\n\tconst response = await fetch('/api/user');\n\n\n\t// NEVER DO THIS!\n\tuser.set(await response.json());\n}\n\nAs with the previous example, this puts one user's information in a place that is shared by all users. Instead, just return the data...\n\n+page.js\nexport async function load({ fetch }) {\n\tconst response = await fetch('/api/user');\n\n\treturn {\n\t\tuser: await response.json()\n\t};\n}\n\n\n...and pass it around to the components that need it, or use $page.data.\n\nIf you're not using SSR, then there's no risk of accidentally exposing one user's data to another. But you should still avoid side-effects in your load functions — your application will be much easier to reason about without them.\n\nUsing stores with context\npermalink\n\nYou might wonder how we're able to use $page.data and other app stores if we can't use our own stores. The answer is that app stores on the server use Svelte's context API — the store is attached to the component tree with setContext, and when you subscribe you retrieve it with getContext. We can do the same thing with our own stores:\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { setContext } from 'svelte';\n\timport { writable } from 'svelte/store';\n\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutData} */\n\texport let data;\n\n\t// Create a store and update it when necessary...\n\tconst user = writable();\n\t$: user.set(data.user);\n\n\t// ...and add it to the context for child components to access\n\tsetContext('user', user);\n</script>\nsrc/routes/user/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { getContext } from 'svelte';\n\n\t// Retrieve user store from context\n\tconst user = getContext('user');\n</script>\n\n<p>Welcome {$user.name}</p>\n\nUpdating the context-based store value in deeper-level pages or components will not affect the value in the parent component when the page is rendered via SSR: The parent component has already been rendered by the time the store value is updated. To avoid values 'flashing' during state updates during hydration, it is generally recommended to pass state down into components rather than up.\n\nIf you're not using SSR (and can guarantee that you won't need to use SSR in future) then you can safely keep state in a shared module, without using the context API.\n\nComponent state is preserved\npermalink\n\nWhen you navigate around your application, SvelteKit reuses existing layout and page components. For example, if you have a route like this...\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n\n\t// THIS CODE IS BUGGY!\n\tconst wordCount = data.content.split(' ').length;\n\tconst estimatedReadingTime = wordCount / 250;\n</script>\n\n<header>\n\t<h1>{data.title}</h1>\n\t<p>Reading time: {Math.round(estimatedReadingTime)} minutes</p>\n</header>\n\n<div>{@html data.content}</div>\n\n...then navigating from /blog/my-short-post to /blog/my-long-post won't cause the component to be destroyed and recreated. The data prop (and by extension data.title and data.content) will change, but because the code isn't rerunning, estimatedReadingTime won't be recalculated.\n\nInstead, we need to make the value reactive:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n\n\t$: wordCount = data.content.split(' ').length;\n\t$: estimatedReadingTime = wordCount / 250;\n</script>\n\n\nReusing components like this means that things like sidebar scroll state are preserved, and you can easily animate between changing values. However, if you do need to completely destroy and remount a component on navigation, you can use this pattern:\n\n{#key $page.url.pathname}\n\t<BlogPost title={data.title} content={data.title} />\n{/key}\nStoring state in the URL\npermalink\n\nIf you have state that should survive a reload and/or affect SSR, such as filters or sorting rules on a table, URL search parameters (like ?sort=price&order=ascending) are a good place to put them. You can put them in <a href=\"...\"> or <form action=\"...\"> attributes, or set them programmatically via goto('?key=value'). They can be accessed inside load functions via the url parameter, and inside components via $page.url.searchParams.\n\nStoring ephemeral state in snapshots\npermalink\n\nSome UI state, such as 'is the accordion open?', is disposable — if the user navigates away or refreshes the page, it doesn't matter if the state is lost. In some cases, you do want the data to persist if the user navigates to a different page and comes back, but storing the state in the URL or in a database would be overkill. For this, SvelteKit provides snapshots, which let you associate component state with a history entry.\n\nPREVIOUS\nPage options\nNEXT\nBuilding your app"

This is done by defining load functions.\n\nPage data\npermalink\n\nA +page.svelte file can have a sibling +page.js that exports a load function, the return value of which is available to the page via the data prop:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport function load({ params }) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tpost: {\n\t\t\ttitle: `Title for ${params.slug} goes here`,\n\t\t\tcontent: `Content for ${params.slug} goes here`\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<h1>{data.post.title}</h1>\n<div>{@html data.post.content}</div>\n\nThanks to the generated $types module, we get full type safety.\n\nA load function in a +page.js file runs both on the server and in the browser (unless combined with export const ssr = false, in which case it will only run in the browser). If your load function should always run on the server (because it uses private environment variables, for example, or accesses a database) then it would go in a +page.server.js instead.\n\nA more realistic version of your blog post's load function, that only runs on the server and pulls data from a database, might look like this:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server.js\nimport * as db from '$lib/server/database';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport async function load({ params }) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tpost: await db.getPost(params.slug)\n\t};\n}\n\nNotice that the type changed from PageLoad to PageServerLoad, because server load functions can access additional arguments. To understand when to use +page.js and when to use +page.server.js, see Universal vs server.\n\nLayout data\npermalink\n\nYour +layout.svelte files can also load data, via +layout.js or +layout.server.js.\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+layout.server.js\nimport * as db from '$lib/server/database';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerLoad} */\nexport async function load() {\n\treturn {\n\t\tposts: await db.getPostSummaries()\n\t};\n}\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+layout.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<main>\n\t<!-- +page.svelte is rendered in this <slot> -->\n\t<slot />\n</main>\n\n<aside>\n\t<h2>More posts</h2>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t{#each data.posts as post}\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/blog/{post.slug}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t{post.title}\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t{/each}\n\t</ul>\n</aside>\n\nData returned from layout load functions is available to child +layout.svelte components and the +page.svelte component as well as the layout that it 'belongs' to.\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { page } from '$app/stores';\n\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n\n\t// we can access `data.posts` because it's returned from\n\t// the parent layout `load` function\n\t$: index = data.posts.findIndex(post => post.slug === $page.params.slug);\n\t$: next = data.posts[index - 1];\n</script>\n\n<h1>{data.post.title}</h1>\n<div>{@html data.post.content}</div>\n\n{#if next}\n\t<p>Next post: <a href=\"/blog/{next.slug}\">{next.title}</a></p>\n{/if}\n\n\nIf multiple load functions return data with the same key, the last one 'wins' — the result of a layout load returning { a: 1, b: 2 } and a page load returning { b: 3, c: 4 } would be { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }.\n\n$page.data\npermalink\n\nThe +page.svelte component, and each +layout.svelte component above it, has access to its own data plus all the data from its parents.\n\nIn some cases, we might need the opposite — a parent layout might need to access page data or data from a child layout. For example, the root layout might want to access a title property returned from a load function in +page.js or +page.server.js. This can be done with $page.data:\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { page } from '$app/stores';\n</script>\n\n<svelte:head>\n\t<title>{$page.data.title}</title>\n</svelte:head>\n\nType information for $page.data is provided by App.\nPageData\n.\n\nUniversal vs server\npermalink\n\nAs we've seen, there are two types of load function:\n\n+page.js and +layout.js files export universal load functions that run both on the server and in the browser\n+page.server.js and +layout.server.js files export server load functions that only run server-side\n\nConceptually, they're the same thing, but there are some important differences to be aware of.\n\nWhen does which load function run?\npermalink\n\nServer load functions always run on the server.\n\nBy default, universal load functions run on the server during SSR when the user first visits your page. They will then run again during hydration, reusing any responses from fetch requests. All subsequent invocations of universal load functions happen in the browser. You can customize the behavior through page options. If you disable server side rendering, you'll get an SPA and universal load functions always run on the client.\n\nA load function is invoked at runtime, unless you prerender the page — in that case, it's invoked at build time.\n\nInput\npermalink\n\nBoth universal and server load functions have access to properties describing the request (params, route and url) and various functions (fetch, setHeaders, parent and depends). These are described in the following sections.\n\nServer load functions are called with a \nServerLoadEvent\n, which inherits clientAddress, cookies, locals, platform and request from \nRequestEvent\n.\n\nUniversal load functions are called with a \nLoadEvent\n, which has a data property. If you have load functions in both +page.js and +page.server.js (or +layout.js and +layout.server.js), the return value of the server load function is the data property of the universal load function's argument.\n\nOutput\npermalink\n\nA universal load function can return an object containing any values, including things like custom classes and component constructors.\n\nA server load function must return data that can be serialized with devalue — anything that can be represented as JSON plus things like BigInt, Date, Map, Set and RegExp, or repeated/cyclical references — so that it can be transported over the network. Your data can include promises, in which case it will be streamed to browsers.\n\nWhen to use which\npermalink\n\nServer load functions are convenient when you need to access data directly from a database or filesystem, or need to use private environment variables.\n\nUniversal load functions are useful when you need to fetch data from an external API and don't need private credentials, since SvelteKit can get the data directly from the API rather than going via your server. They are also useful when you need to return something that can't be serialized, such as a Svelte component constructor.\n\nIn rare cases, you might need to use both together — for example, you might need to return an instance of a custom class that was initialised with data from your server.\n\nUsing URL data\npermalink\n\nOften the load function depends on the URL in one way or another. For this, the load function provides you with url, route and params.\n\nurl\npermalink\n\nAn instance of URL, containing properties like the origin, hostname, pathname and searchParams (which contains the parsed query string as a URLSearchParams object). url.hash cannot be accessed during load, since it is unavailable on the server.\n\nIn some environments this is derived from request headers during server-side rendering. If you're using adapter-node, for example, you may need to configure the adapter in order for the URL to be correct.\n\nroute\npermalink\n\nContains the name of the current route directory, relative to src/routes:\n\nsrc/routes/a/[b]/[...c]/+page.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport function load({ route }) {\n\tconsole.log(route.id); // '/a/[b]/[...c]'\n}\nparams\npermalink\n\nparams is derived from url.pathname and route.id.\n\nGiven a route.id of /a/[b]/[...c] and a url.pathname of /a/x/y/z, the params object would look like this:\n\n{\n\t\"b\": \"x\",\n\t\"c\": \"y/z\"\n}\nMaking fetch requests\npermalink\n\nTo get data from an external API or a +server.js handler, you can use the provided fetch function, which behaves identically to the native fetch web API with a few additional features:\n\nIt can be used to make credentialed requests on the server, as it inherits the cookie and authorization headers for the page request.\nIt can make relative requests on the server (ordinarily, fetch requires a URL with an origin when used in a server context).\nInternal requests (e.g. for +server.js routes) go directly to the handler function when running on the server, without the overhead of an HTTP call.\nDuring server-side rendering, the response will be captured and inlined into the rendered HTML by hooking into the text and json methods of the Response object. Note that headers will not be serialized, unless explicitly included via filterSerializedResponseHeaders.\nDuring hydration, the response will be read from the HTML, guaranteeing consistency and preventing an additional network request - if you received a warning in your browser console when using the browser fetch instead of the load fetch, this is why.\nsrc/routes/items/[id]/+page.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport async function load({ fetch, params }) {\n\tconst res = await fetch(`/api/items/${params.id}`);\n\tconst item = await res.json();\n\n\n\treturn { item };\n}\nCookies\npermalink\n\nA server load function can get and set cookies.\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.server.js\nimport * as db from '$lib/server/database';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerLoad} */\nexport async function load({ cookies }) {\n\tconst sessionid = cookies.get('sessionid');\n\n\n\treturn {\n\t\tuser: await db.getUser(sessionid)\n\t};\n}\n\nCookies will only be passed through the provided fetch function if the target host is the same as the SvelteKit application or a more specific subdomain of it.\n\nFor example, if SvelteKit is serving my.domain.com:\n\ndomain.com WILL NOT receive cookies\nmy.domain.com WILL receive cookies\napi.domain.dom WILL NOT receive cookies\nsub.my.domain.com WILL receive cookies\n\nOther cookies will not be passed when credentials: 'include' is set, because SvelteKit does not know which domain which cookie belongs to (the browser does not pass this information along), so it's not safe to forward any of them. Use the handleFetch hook to work around it.\n\nWhen setting cookies, be aware of the path property. By default, the path of a cookie is the current pathname. If you for example set a cookie at page admin/user, the cookie will only be available within the admin pages by default. In most cases you likely want to set path to '/' to make the cookie available throughout your app.\n\nHeaders\npermalink\n\nBoth server and universal load functions have access to a setHeaders function that, when running on the server, can set headers for the response. (When running in the browser, setHeaders has no effect.) This is useful if you want the page to be cached, for example:\n\nsrc/routes/products/+page.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport async function load({ fetch, setHeaders }) {\n\tconst url = `https://cms.example.com/products.json`;\n\tconst response = await fetch(url);\n\n\n\t// cache the page for the same length of time\n\t// as the underlying data\n\tsetHeaders({\n\t\tage: response.headers.get('age'),\n\t\t'cache-control': response.headers.get('cache-control')\n\t});\n\n\n\treturn response.json();\n}\n\nSetting the same header multiple times (even in separate load functions) is an error — you can only set a given header once. You cannot add a set-cookie header with setHeaders — use cookies.set(name, value, options) instead.\n\nUsing parent data\npermalink\n\nOccasionally it's useful for a load function to access data from a parent load function, which can be done with await parent():\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutLoad} */\nexport function load() {\n\treturn { a: 1 };\n}\nsrc/routes/abc/+layout.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutLoad} */\nexport async function load({ parent }) {\n\tconst { a } = await parent();\n\treturn { b: a + 1 };\n}\nsrc/routes/abc/+page.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport async function load({ parent }) {\n\tconst { a, b } = await parent();\n\treturn { c: a + b };\n}\nsrc/routes/abc/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<!-- renders `1 + 2 = 3` -->\n<p>{data.a} + {data.b} = {data.c}</p>\n\nNotice that the load function in +page.js receives the merged data from both layout load functions, not just the immediate parent.\n\nInside +page.server.js and +layout.server.js, parent returns data from parent +layout.server.js files.\n\nIn +page.js or +layout.js it will return data from parent +layout.js files. However, a missing +layout.js is treated as a ({ data }) => data function, meaning that it will also return data from parent +layout.server.js files that are not 'shadowed' by a +layout.js file\n\nTake care not to introduce waterfalls when using await parent(). Here, for example, getData(params) does not depend on the result of calling parent(), so we should call it first to avoid a delayed render.\n\n+page.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport async function load({ params, parent }) {\n\tconst parentData = await parent();\n\tconst data = await getData(params);\n\tconst parentData = await parent();\n\n\treturn {\n\t\t...data\n\t\tmeta: { ...parentData.meta, ...data.meta }\n\t};\n}\n\nErrors\npermalink\n\nIf an error is thrown during load, the nearest +error.svelte will be rendered. For expected errors, use the error helper from @sveltejs/kit to specify the HTTP status code and an optional message:\n\nsrc/routes/admin/+layout.server.js\nimport { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerLoad} */\nexport function load({ locals }) {\n\tif (!locals.user) {\n\t\tthrow error(401, 'not logged in');\n\t}\n\n\n\tif (!locals.user.isAdmin) {\n\t\tthrow error(403, 'not an admin');\n\t}\n}\n\nIf an unexpected error is thrown, SvelteKit will invoke handleError and treat it as a 500 Internal Error.\n\nRedirects\npermalink\n\nTo redirect users, use the redirect helper from @sveltejs/kit to specify the location to which they should be redirected alongside a 3xx status code.\n\nsrc/routes/user/+layout.server.js\nimport { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerLoad} */\nexport function load({ locals }) {\n\tif (!locals.user) {\n\t\tthrow redirect(307, '/login');\n\t}\n}\n\nDon't use throw redirect() from within a try-catch block, as the redirect will immediately trigger the catch statement.\n\nIn the browser, you can also navigate programmatically outside of a load function using goto from $app.navigation.\n\nStreaming with promises\npermalink\n\nPromises at the top level of the returned object will be awaited, making it easy to return multiple promises without creating a waterfall. When using a server load, nested promises will be streamed to the browser as they resolve. This is useful if you have slow, non-essential data, since you can start rendering the page before all the data is available:\n\nsrc/routes/+page.server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport function load() {\n\treturn {\n\t\tone: Promise.resolve(1),\n\t\ttwo: Promise.resolve(2),\n\t\tstreamed: {\n\t\t\tthree: new Promise((fulfil) => {\n\t\t\t\tsetTimeout(() => {\n\t\t\t\t\tfulfil(3)\n\t\t\t\t}, 1000);\n\t\t\t})\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nThis is useful for creating skeleton loading states, for example:\n\nsrc/routes/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<p>\n\tone: {data.one}\n</p>\n<p>\n\ttwo: {data.two}\n</p>\n<p>\n\tthree:\n\t{#await data.streamed.three}\n\t\tLoading...\n\t{:then value}\n\t\t{value}\n\t{:catch error}\n\t\t{error.message}\n\t{/await}\n</p>\n\nOn platforms that do not support streaming, such as AWS Lambda, responses will be buffered. This means the page will only render once all promises resolve. If you are using a proxy (e.g. NGINX), make sure it does not buffer responses from the proxied server.\n\nStreaming data will only work when JavaScript is enabled. You should avoid returning nested promises from a universal load function if the page is server rendered, as these are not streamed — instead, the promise is recreated when the function reruns in the browser.\n\nThe headers and status code of a response cannot be changed once the response has started streaming, therefore you cannot setHeaders or throw redirects inside a streamed promise.\n\nParallel loading\npermalink\n\nWhen rendering (or navigating to) a page, SvelteKit runs all load functions concurrently, avoiding a waterfall of requests. During client-side navigation, the result of calling multiple server load functions are grouped into a single response. Once all load functions have returned, the page is rendered.\n\nRerunning load functions\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit tracks the dependencies of each load function to avoid rerunning it unnecessarily during navigation.\n\nFor example, given a pair of load functions like these...\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server.js\nimport * as db from '$lib/server/database';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport async function load({ params }) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tpost: await db.getPost(params.slug)\n\t};\n}\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+layout.server.js\nimport * as db from '$lib/server/database';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerLoad} */\nexport async function load() {\n\treturn {\n\t\tposts: await db.getPostSummaries()\n\t};\n}\n\n...the one in +page.server.js will rerun if we navigate from /blog/trying-the-raw-meat-diet to /blog/i-regret-my-choices because params.slug has changed. The one in +layout.server.js will not, because the data is still valid. In other words, we won't call db.getPostSummaries() a second time.\n\nA load function that calls await parent() will also rerun if a parent load function is rerun.\n\nDependency tracking does not apply after the load function has returned — for example, accessing params.x inside a nested promise will not cause the function to rerun when params.x changes. (Don't worry, you'll get a warning in development if you accidentally do this.) Instead, access the parameter in the main body of your load function.\n\nManual invalidation\npermalink\n\nYou can also rerun load functions that apply to the current page using invalidate(url), which reruns all load functions that depend on url, and invalidateAll(), which reruns every load function. Server load functions will never automatically depend on a fetched url to avoid leaking secrets to the client.\n\nA load function depends on url if it calls fetch(url) or depends(url). Note that url can be a custom identifier that starts with [a-z]::\n\nsrc/routes/random-number/+page.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport async function load({ fetch, depends }) {\n\t// load reruns when `invalidate('https://api.example.com/random-number')` is called...\n\tconst response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/random-number');\n\n\n\t// ...or when `invalidate('app:random')` is called\n\tdepends('app:random');\n\n\n\treturn {\n\t\tnumber: await response.json()\n\t};\n}\nsrc/routes/random-number/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { invalidate, invalidateAll } from '$app/navigation';\n\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n\n\tfunction rerunLoadFunction() {\n\t\t// any of these will cause the `load` function to rerun\n\t\tinvalidate('app:random');\n\t\tinvalidate('https://api.example.com/random-number');\n\t\tinvalidate(url => url.href.includes('random-number'));\n\t\tinvalidateAll();\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<p>random number: {data.number}</p>\n<button on:click={rerunLoadFunction}>Update random number</button>\nWhen do load functions rerun?\npermalink\n\nTo summarize, a load function will rerun in the following situations:\n\nIt references a property of params whose value has changed\nIt references a property of url (such as url.pathname or url.search) whose value has changed. Properties in request.url are not tracked\nIt calls await parent() and a parent load function reran\nIt declared a dependency on a specific URL via fetch (universal load only) or depends, and that URL was marked invalid with invalidate(url)\nAll active load functions were forcibly rerun with invalidateAll()\n\nparams and url can change in response to a <a href=\"..\"> link click, a <form> interaction, a goto invocation, or a redirect.\n\nNote that rerunning a load function will update the data prop inside the corresponding +layout.svelte or +page.svelte; it does not cause the component to be recreated. As a result, internal state is preserved. If this isn't what you want, you can reset whatever you need to reset inside an afterNavigate callback, and/or wrap your component in a {#key ...} block.\n\nFurther reading\npermalink\nTutorial: Loading data\nTutorial: Errors and redirects\nTutorial: Advanced loading\nPREVIOUS\nRouting\nNEXT\nForm actions"

    "html": "CORE CONCEPTS\n\nRouting\nRouting\n+page\n+error\n+layout\n+server\n$types\nOther files\nFurther reading\n\nAt the heart of SvelteKit is a filesystem-based router. The routes of your app — i.e. the URL paths that users can access — are defined by the directories in your codebase:\n\nsrc/routes is the root route\nsrc/routes/about creates an /about route\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug] creates a route with a parameter, slug, that can be used to load data dynamically when a user requests a page like /blog/hello-world\n\nYou can change src/routes to a different directory by editing the project config.\n\nEach route directory contains one or more route files, which can be identified by their + prefix.\n\n+page\npermalink\n+page.svelte\npermalink\n\nA +page.svelte component defines a page of your app. By default, pages are rendered both on the server (SSR) for the initial request and in the browser (CSR) for subsequent navigation.\n\nsrc/routes/+page.svelte\n<h1>Hello and welcome to my site!</h1>\n<a href=\"/about\">About my site</a>\nsrc/routes/about/+page.svelte\n<h1>About this site</h1>\n<p>TODO...</p>\n<a href=\"/\">Home</a>\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<h1>{data.title}</h1>\n<div>{@html data.content}</div>\n\nNote that SvelteKit uses <a> elements to navigate between routes, rather than a framework-specific <Link> component.\n\n+page.js\npermalink\n\nOften, a page will need to load some data before it can be rendered. For this, we add a +page.js module that exports a load function:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.js\nimport { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport function load({ params }) {\n\tif (params.slug === 'hello-world') {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\ttitle: 'Hello world!',\n\t\t\tcontent: 'Welcome to our blog. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...'\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\n\n\tthrow error(404, 'Not found');\n}\n\nThis function runs alongside +page.svelte, which means it runs on the server during server-side rendering and in the browser during client-side navigation. See load for full details of the API.\n\nAs well as load, +page.js can export values that configure the page's behaviour:\n\nexport const prerender = true or false or 'auto'\nexport const ssr = true or false\nexport const csr = true or false\n\nYou can find more information about these in page options.\n\n+page.server.js\npermalink\n\nIf your load function can only run on the server — for example, if it needs to fetch data from a database or you need to access private environment variables like API keys — then you can rename +page.js to +page.server.js and change the PageLoad type to PageServerLoad.\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server.js\nimport { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */\nexport async function load({ params }) {\n\tconst post = await getPostFromDatabase(params.slug);\n\n\n\tif (post) {\n\t\treturn post;\n\t}\n\n\n\tthrow error(404, 'Not found');\n}\n\nDuring client-side navigation, SvelteKit will load this data from the server, which means that the returned value must be serializable using devalue. See load for full details of the API.\n\nLike +page.js, +page.server.js can export page options — prerender, ssr and csr.\n\nA +page.server.js file can also export actions. If load lets you read data from the server, actions let you write data to the server using the <form> element. To learn how to use them, see the form actions section.\n\n+error\npermalink\n\nIf an error occurs during load, SvelteKit will render a default error page. You can customise this error page on a per-route basis by adding an +error.svelte file:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+error.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { page } from '$app/stores';\n</script>\n\n<h1>{$page.status}: {$page.error.message}</h1>\n\nSvelteKit will 'walk up the tree' looking for the closest error boundary — if the file above didn't exist it would try src/routes/blog/+error.svelte and then src/routes/+error.svelte before rendering the default error page. If that fails (or if the error was thrown from the load function of the root +layout, which sits 'above' the root +error), SvelteKit will bail out and render a static fallback error page, which you can customise by creating a src/error.html file.\n\nIf the error occurs inside a load function in +layout(.server).js, the closest error boundary in the tree is an +error.svelte file above that layout (not next to it).\n\nIf no route can be found (404), src/routes/+error.svelte (or the default error page, if that file does not exist) will be used.\n\n+error.svelte is not used when an error occurs inside handle or a +server.js request handler.\n\nYou can read more about error handling here.\n\n+layout\npermalink\n\nSo far, we've treated pages as entirely standalone components — upon navigation, the existing +page.svelte component will be destroyed, and a new one will take its place.\n\nBut in many apps, there are elements that should be visible on every page, such as top-level navigation or a footer. Instead of repeating them in every +page.svelte, we can put them in layouts.\n\n+layout.svelte\npermalink\n\nTo create a layout that applies to every page, make a file called src/routes/+layout.svelte. The default layout (the one that SvelteKit uses if you don't bring your own) looks like this...\n\n<slot></slot>\n\n...but we can add whatever markup, styles and behaviour we want. The only requirement is that the component includes a <slot> for the page content. For example, let's add a nav bar:\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\">Home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\">About</a>\n\t<a href=\"/settings\">Settings</a>\n</nav>\n\n<slot></slot>\n\nIf we create pages for /, /about and /settings...\n\nsrc/routes/+page.svelte\n<h1>Home</h1>\nsrc/routes/about/+page.svelte\n<h1>About</h1>\nsrc/routes/settings/+page.svelte\n<h1>Settings</h1>\n\n...the nav will always be visible, and clicking between the three pages will only result in the <h1> being replaced.\n\nLayouts can be nested. Suppose we don't just have a single /settings page, but instead have nested pages like /settings/profile and /settings/notifications with a shared submenu (for a real-life example, see github.com/settings).\n\nWe can create a layout that only applies to pages below /settings (while inheriting the root layout with the top-level nav):\n\nsrc/routes/settings/+layout.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\n<h1>Settings</h1>\n\n<div class=\"submenu\">\n\t{#each data.sections as section}\n\t\t<a href=\"/settings/{section.slug}\">{section.title}</a>\n\t{/each}\n</div>\n\n<slot></slot>\n\nBy default, each layout inherits the layout above it. Sometimes that isn't what you want - in this case, advanced layouts can help you.\n\n+layout.js\npermalink\n\nJust like +page.svelte loading data from +page.js, your +layout.svelte component can get data from a load function in +layout.js.\n\nsrc/routes/settings/+layout.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutLoad} */\nexport function load() {\n\treturn {\n\t\tsections: [\n\t\t\t{ slug: 'profile', title: 'Profile' },\n\t\t\t{ slug: 'notifications', title: 'Notifications' }\n\t\t]\n\t};\n}\n\nIf a +layout.js exports page options — prerender, ssr and csr — they will be used as defaults for child pages.\n\nData returned from a layout's load function is also available to all its child pages:\n\nsrc/routes/settings/profile/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n\n\tconsole.log(data.sections); // [{ slug: 'profile', title: 'Profile' }, ...]\n</script>\n\nOften, layout data is unchanged when navigating between pages. SvelteKit will intelligently rerun load functions when necessary.\n\n+layout.server.js\npermalink\n\nTo run your layout's load function on the server, move it to +layout.server.js, and change the LayoutLoad type to LayoutServerLoad.\n\nLike +layout.js, +layout.server.js can export page options — prerender, ssr and csr.\n\n+server\npermalink\n\nAs well as pages, you can define routes with a +server.js file (sometimes referred to as an 'API route' or an 'endpoint'), which gives you full control over the response. Your +server.js file exports functions corresponding to HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and HEAD that take a \nRequestEvent\n argument and return a Response object.\n\nFor example we could create an /api/random-number route with a GET handler:\n\nsrc/routes/api/random-number/+server.js\nimport { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport function GET({ url }) {\n\tconst min = Number(url.searchParams.get('min') ?? '0');\n\tconst max = Number(url.searchParams.get('max') ?? '1');\n\n\n\tconst d = max - min;\n\n\n\tif (isNaN(d) || d < 0) {\n\t\tthrow error(400, 'min and max must be numbers, and min must be less than max');\n\t}\n\n\n\tconst random = min + Math.random() * d;\n\n\n\treturn new Response(String(random));\n}\n\nThe first argument to Response can be a ReadableStream, making it possible to stream large amounts of data or create server-sent events (unless deploying to platforms that buffer responses, like AWS Lambda).\n\nYou can use the error, redirect and json methods from @sveltejs/kit for convenience (but you don't have to).\n\nIf an error is thrown (either throw error(...) or an unexpected error), the response will be a JSON representation of the error or a fallback error page — which can be customised via src/error.html — depending on the Accept header. The +error.svelte component will not be rendered in this case. You can read more about error handling here.\n\nWhen creating an OPTIONS handler, note that Vite will inject Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Methods headers — these will not be present in production unless you add them.\n\nReceiving data\npermalink\n\nBy exporting POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/OPTIONS/HEAD handlers, +server.js files can be used to create a complete API:\n\nsrc/routes/add/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\tlet a = 0;\n\tlet b = 0;\n\tlet total = 0;\n\n\tasync function add() {\n\t\tconst response = await fetch('/api/add', {\n\t\t\tmethod: 'POST',\n\t\t\tbody: JSON.stringify({ a, b }),\n\t\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t\t'content-type': 'application/json'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\n\t\ttotal = await response.json();\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<input type=\"number\" bind:value={a}> +\n<input type=\"number\" bind:value={b}> =\n{total}\n\n<button on:click={add}>Calculate</button>\nsrc/routes/api/add/+server.js\nimport { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport async function POST({ request }) {\n\tconst { a, b } = await request.json();\n\treturn json(a + b);\n}\n\nIn general, form actions are a better way to submit data from the browser to the server.\n\nIf a GET handler is exported, a HEAD request will return the content-length of the GET handler's response body.\n\nFallback method handler\npermalink\n\nExporting the fallback handler will match any unhandled request methods, including methods like MOVE which have no dedicated export from +server.js.\n\nsrc/routes/api/add/+server.js\nimport { json, text } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\nexport async function POST({ request }) {\n\tconst { a, b } = await request.json();\n\treturn json(a + b);\n}\n\n\n// This handler will respond to PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport async function fallback({ request }) {\n\treturn text(`I caught your ${request.method} request!`);\n}\n\nFor HEAD requests, the GET handler takes precedence over the fallback handler.\n\nContent negotiation\npermalink\n\n+server.js files can be placed in the same directory as +page files, allowing the same route to be either a page or an API endpoint. To determine which, SvelteKit applies the following rules:\n\nPUT/PATCH/DELETE/OPTIONS requests are always handled by +server.js since they do not apply to pages\nGET/POST/HEAD requests are treated as page requests if the accept header prioritises text/html (in other words, it's a browser page request), else they are handled by +server.js.\nResponses to GET requests will include a Vary: Accept header, so that proxies and browsers cache HTML and JSON responses separately.\n$types\npermalink\n\nThroughout the examples above, we've been importing types from a $types.d.ts file. This is a file SvelteKit creates for you in a hidden directory if you're using TypeScript (or JavaScript with JSDoc type annotations) to give you type safety when working with your root files.\n\nFor example, annotating export let data with \nPageData\n (or LayoutData, for a +layout.svelte file) tells TypeScript that the type of data is whatever was returned from load:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte\n<script>\n\t/** @type {import('./$types').PageData} */\n\texport let data;\n</script>\n\nIn turn, annotating the load function with PageLoad, PageServerLoad, LayoutLoad or LayoutServerLoad (for +page.js, +page.server.js, +layout.js and +layout.server.js respectively) ensures that params and the return value are correctly typed.\n\nIf you're using VS Code or any IDE that supports the language server protocol and TypeScript plugins then you can omit these types entirely! Svelte's IDE tooling will insert the correct types for you, so you'll get type checking without writing them yourself. It also works with our command line tool svelte-check.\n\nYou can read more about omitting $types in our blog post about it.\n\nOther files\npermalink\n\nAny other files inside a route directory are ignored by SvelteKit. This means you can colocate components and utility modules with the routes that need them.\n\nIf components and modules are needed by multiple routes, it's a good idea to put them in $lib.\n\nFurther reading\npermalink\nTutorial: Routing\nTutorial: API routes\nDocs: Advanced routing\nPREVIOUS\nWeb standards\nNEXT\nLoading data"

    "html": "GETTING STARTED\n\nWeb standards\nWeb standards\nFetch APIs\nFormData\nStream APIs\nURL APIs\nWeb Crypto\n\nThroughout this documentation, you'll see references to the standard Web APIs that SvelteKit builds on top of. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we use the platform, which means your existing web development skills are applicable to SvelteKit. Conversely, time spent learning SvelteKit will help you be a better web developer elsewhere.\n\nThese APIs are available in all modern browsers and in many non-browser environments like Cloudflare Workers, Deno and Vercel Edge Functions. During development, and in adapters for Node-based environments (including AWS Lambda), they're made available via polyfills where necessary (for now, that is — Node is rapidly adding support for more web standards).\n\nIn particular, you'll get comfortable with the following:\n\nFetch APIs\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit uses fetch for getting data from the network. It's available in hooks and server routes as well as in the browser.\n\nA special version of fetch is available in load functions, server hooks and API routes for invoking endpoints directly during server-side rendering, without making an HTTP call, while preserving credentials. (To make credentialled fetches in server-side code outside load, you must explicitly pass cookie and/or authorization headers.) It also allows you to make relative requests, whereas server-side fetch normally requires a fully qualified URL.\n\nBesides fetch itself, the Fetch API includes the following interfaces:\n\nRequest\npermalink\n\nAn instance of Request is accessible in hooks and server routes as event.request. It contains useful methods like request.json() and request.formData() for getting data that was posted to an endpoint.\n\nResponse\npermalink\n\nAn instance of Response is returned from await fetch(...) and handlers in +server.js files. Fundamentally, a SvelteKit app is a machine for turning a Request into a Response.\n\nHeaders\npermalink\n\nThe Headers interface allows you to read incoming request.headers and set outgoing response.headers. For example, you can get the request.headers as shown below, and use the json convenience function to send modified response.headers:\n\nsrc/routes/what-is-my-user-agent/+server.js\nimport { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport function GET({ request }) {\n\t// log all headers\n\tconsole.log(...request.headers);\n\n\n\t// create a JSON Response using a header we received\n\treturn json({\n\t\t// retrieve a specific header\n\t\tuserAgent: request.headers.get('user-agent')\n\t}, {\n\t\t// set a header on the response\n\t\theaders: { 'x-custom-header': 'potato' }\n\t});\n}\nFormData\npermalink\n\nWhen dealing with HTML native form submissions you'll be working with FormData objects.\n\nsrc/routes/hello/+server.js\nimport { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport async function POST(event) {\n\tconst body = await event.request.formData();\n\n\n\t// log all fields\n\tconsole.log([...body]);\n\n\n\treturn json({\n\t\t// get a specific field's value\n\t\tname: body.get('name') ?? 'world'\n\t});\n}\nStream APIs\npermalink\n\nMost of the time, your endpoints will return complete data, as in the userAgent example above. Sometimes, you may need to return a response that's too large to fit in memory in one go, or is delivered in chunks, and for this the platform provides streams — ReadableStream, WritableStream and TransformStream.\n\nURL APIs\npermalink\n\nURLs are represented by the URL interface, which includes useful properties like origin and pathname (and, in the browser, hash). This interface shows up in various places — event.url in hooks and server routes, $page.url in pages, from and to in beforeNavigate and afterNavigate and so on.\n\nURLSearchParams\npermalink\n\nWherever you encounter a URL, you can access query parameters via url.searchParams, which is an instance of URLSearchParams:\n\nconst foo = url.searchParams.get('foo');\nWeb Crypto\npermalink\n\nThe Web Crypto API is made available via the crypto global. It's used internally for Content Security Policy headers, but you can also use it for things like generating UUIDs:\n\nconst uuid = crypto.randomUUID();\nPREVIOUS\nProject structure\nNEXT\nRouting"

    "html": "CORE CONCEPTS\n\nPage options\nPage options\nprerender\nentries\nssr\ncsr\ntrailingSlash\nconfig\nFurther reading\n\nBy default, SvelteKit will render (or prerender) any component first on the server and send it to the client as HTML. It will then render the component again in the browser to make it interactive in a process called hydration. For this reason, you need to ensure that components can run in both places. SvelteKit will then initialize a router that takes over subsequent navigations.\n\nYou can control each of these on a page-by-page basis by exporting options from +page.js or +page.server.js, or for groups of pages using a shared +layout.js or +layout.server.js. To define an option for the whole app, export it from the root layout. Child layouts and pages override values set in parent layouts, so — for example — you can enable prerendering for your entire app then disable it for pages that need to be dynamically rendered.\n\nYou can mix and match these options in different areas of your app. For example you could prerender your marketing page for maximum speed, server-render your dynamic pages for SEO and accessibility and turn your admin section into an SPA by rendering it on the client only. This makes SvelteKit very versatile.\n\nprerender\npermalink\n\nIt's likely that at least some routes of your app can be represented as a simple HTML file generated at build time. These routes can be prerendered.\n\n+page.js/+page.server.js/+server.js\nexport const prerender = true;\n\nAlternatively, you can set export const prerender = true in your root +layout.js or +layout.server.js and prerender everything except pages that are explicitly marked as not prerenderable:\n\n+page.js/+page.server.js/+server.js\nexport const prerender = false;\n\nRoutes with prerender = true will be excluded from manifests used for dynamic SSR, making your server (or serverless/edge functions) smaller. In some cases you might want to prerender a route but also include it in the manifest (for example, with a route like /blog/[slug] where you want to prerender your most recent/popular content but server-render the long tail) — for these cases, there's a third option, 'auto':\n\n+page.js/+page.server.js/+server.js\nexport const prerender = 'auto';\n\nIf your entire app is suitable for prerendering, you can use adapter-static, which will output files suitable for use with any static webserver.\n\nThe prerenderer will start at the root of your app and generate files for any prerenderable pages or +server.js routes it finds. Each page is scanned for <a> elements that point to other pages that are candidates for prerendering — because of this, you generally don't need to specify which pages should be accessed. If you do need to specify which pages should be accessed by the prerenderer, you can do so with config.kit.prerender.entries, or by exporting an entries function from your dynamic route.\n\nWhile prerendering, the value of building imported from $app/environment will be true.\n\nPrerendering server routes\npermalink\n\nUnlike the other page options, prerender also applies to +server.js files. These files are not affected from layouts, but will inherit default values from the pages that fetch data from them, if any. For example if a +page.js contains this load function...\n\n+page.js\nexport const prerender = true;\n\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport async function load({ fetch }) {\n\tconst res = await fetch('/my-server-route.json');\n\treturn await res.json();\n}\n\n...then src/routes/my-server-route.json/+server.js will be treated as prerenderable if it doesn't contain its own export const prerender = false.\n\nWhen not to prerender\npermalink\n\nThe basic rule is this: for a page to be prerenderable, any two users hitting it directly must get the same content from the server.\n\nNot all pages are suitable for prerendering. Any content that is prerendered will be seen by all users. You can of course fetch personalized data in onMount in a prerendered page, but this may result in a poorer user experience since it will involve blank initial content or loading indicators.\n\nNote that you can still prerender pages that load data based on the page's parameters, such as a src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte route.\n\nAccessing url.searchParams during prerendering is forbidden. If you need to use it, ensure you are only doing so in the browser (for example in onMount).\n\nPages with actions cannot be prerendered, because a server must be able to handle the action POST requests.\n\nRoute conflicts\npermalink\n\nBecause prerendering writes to the filesystem, it isn't possible to have two endpoints that would cause a directory and a file to have the same name. For example, src/routes/foo/+server.js and src/routes/foo/bar/+server.js would try to create foo and foo/bar, which is impossible.\n\nFor that reason among others, it's recommended that you always include a file extension — src/routes/foo.json/+server.js and src/routes/foo/bar.json/+server.js would result in foo.json and foo/bar.json files living harmoniously side-by-side.\n\nFor pages, we skirt around this problem by writing foo/index.html instead of foo.\n\nTroubleshooting\npermalink\n\nIf you encounter an error like 'The following routes were marked as prerenderable, but were not prerendered' it's because the route in question (or a parent layout, if it's a page) has export const prerender = true but the page wasn't actually prerendered, because it wasn't reached by the prerendering crawler.\n\nSince these routes cannot be dynamically server-rendered, this will cause errors when people try to access the route in question. There are two ways to fix it:\n\nEnsure that SvelteKit can find the route by following links from config.kit.prerender.entries or the entries page option. Add links to dynamic routes (i.e. pages with [parameters] ) to this option if they are not found through crawling the other entry points, else they are not prerendered because SvelteKit doesn't know what value the parameters should have. Pages not marked as prerenderable will be ignored and their links to other pages will not be crawled, even if some of them would be prerenderable.\nChange export const prerender = true to export const prerender = 'auto'. Routes with 'auto' can be dynamically server rendered\nentries\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit will discover pages to prerender automatically, by starting at entry points and crawling them. By default, all your non-dynamic routes are considered entry points — for example, if you have these routes...\n\n/             # non-dynamic\n/blog         # non-dynamic\n/blog/[slug]  # dynamic, because of `[slug]`\n\n...SvelteKit will prerender / and /blog, and in the process discover links like <a href=\"/blog/hello-world\"> which give it new pages to prerender.\n\nMost of the time, that's enough. In some situations, links to pages like /blog/hello-world might not exist (or might not exist on prerendered pages), in which case we need to tell SvelteKit about their existence.\n\nThis can be done with config.kit.prerender.entries, or by exporting an entries function from a +page.js, a +page.server.js or a +server.js belonging to a dynamic route:\n\nsrc/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').EntryGenerator} */\nexport function entries() {\n\treturn [\n\t\t{ slug: 'hello-world' },\n\t\t{ slug: 'another-blog-post' }\n\t];\n}\n\n\nexport const prerender = true;\n\nentries can be an async function, allowing you to (for example) retrieve a list of posts from a CMS or database, in the example above.\n\nssr\npermalink\n\nNormally, SvelteKit renders your page on the server first and sends that HTML to the client where it's hydrated. If you set ssr to false, it renders an empty 'shell' page instead. This is useful if your page is unable to be rendered on the server (because you use browser-only globals like document for example), but in most situations it's not recommended (see appendix).\n\n+page.js\nexport const ssr = false;\n\nIf you add export const ssr = false to your root +layout.js, your entire app will only be rendered on the client — which essentially means you turn your app into an SPA.\n\ncsr\npermalink\n\nOrdinarily, SvelteKit hydrates your server-rendered HTML into an interactive client-side-rendered (CSR) page. Some pages don't require JavaScript at all — many blog posts and 'about' pages fall into this category. In these cases you can disable CSR:\n\n+page.js\nexport const csr = false;\n\nIf both ssr and csr are false, nothing will be rendered!\n\ntrailingSlash\npermalink\n\nBy default, SvelteKit will remove trailing slashes from URLs — if you visit /about/, it will respond with a redirect to /about. You can change this behaviour with the trailingSlash option, which can be one of 'never' (the default), 'always', or 'ignore'.\n\nAs with other page options, you can export this value from a +layout.js or a +layout.server.js and it will apply to all child pages. You can also export the configuration from +server.js files.\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.js\nexport const trailingSlash = 'always';\n\nThis option also affects prerendering. If trailingSlash is always, a route like /about will result in an about/index.html file, otherwise it will create about.html, mirroring static webserver conventions.\n\nIgnoring trailing slashes is not recommended — the semantics of relative paths differ between the two cases (./y from /x is /y, but from /x/ is /x/y), and /x and /x/ are treated as separate URLs which is harmful to SEO.\n\nconfig\npermalink\n\nWith the concept of adapters, SvelteKit is able to run on a variety of platforms. Each of these might have specific configuration to further tweak the deployment — for example on Vercel you could choose to deploy some parts of your app on the edge and others on serverless environments.\n\nconfig is an object with key-value pairs at the top level. Beyond that, the concrete shape is dependent on the adapter you're using. Every adapter should provide a \nConfig\n interface to import for type safety. Consult the documentation of your adapter for more information.\n\nsrc/routes/+page.js\n/** @type {import('some-adapter').Config} */\nexport const config = {\n\truntime: 'edge'\n};\n\nconfig objects are merged at the top level (but not deeper levels). This means you don't need to repeat all the values in a +page.js if you want to only override some of the values in the upper +layout.js. For example this layout configuration...\n\nsrc/routes/+layout.js\nexport const config = {\n\truntime: 'edge',\n\tregions: 'all',\n\tfoo: {\n\t\tbar: true\n\t}\n}\n\n...is overridden by this page configuration...\n\nsrc/routes/+page.js\nexport const config = {\n\tregions: ['us1', 'us2'],\n\tfoo: {\n\t\tbaz: true\n\t}\n}\n\n...which results in the config value { runtime: 'edge', regions: ['us1', 'us2'], foo: { baz: true } } for that page.\n\nFurther reading\npermalink\nTutorial: Page options\nPREVIOUS\nForm actions\nNEXT\nState management"

These can be applied to the <a> itself, or to a parent element.\n\nThese options also apply to <form> elements with method=\"GET\".\n\ndata-sveltekit-preload-data\npermalink\n\nBefore the browser registers that the user has clicked on a link, we can detect that they've hovered the mouse over it (on desktop) or that a touchstart or mousedown event was triggered. In both cases, we can make an educated guess that a click event is coming.\n\nSvelteKit can use this information to get a head start on importing the code and fetching the page's data, which can give us an extra couple of hundred milliseconds — the difference between a user interface that feels laggy and one that feels snappy.\n\nWe can control this behaviour with the data-sveltekit-preload-data attribute, which can have one of two values:\n\n\"hover\" means that preloading will start if the mouse comes to a rest over a link. On mobile, preloading begins on touchstart\n\"tap\" means that preloading will start as soon as a touchstart or mousedown event is registered\n\nThe default project template has a data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"hover\" attribute applied to the <body> element in src/app.html, meaning that every link is preloaded on hover by default:\n\n<body data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"hover\">\n\t<div style=\"display: contents\">%sveltekit.body%</div>\n</body>\n\nSometimes, calling load when the user hovers over a link might be undesirable, either because it's likely to result in false positives (a click needn't follow a hover) or because data is updating very quickly and a delay could mean staleness.\n\nIn these cases, you can specify the \"tap\" value, which causes SvelteKit to call load only when the user taps or clicks on a link:\n\n<a data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"tap\" href=\"/stonks\">\n\tGet current stonk values\n</a>\n\nYou can also programmatically invoke preloadData from $app/navigation.\n\nData will never be preloaded if the user has chosen reduced data usage, meaning navigator.connection.saveData is true.\n\ndata-sveltekit-preload-code\npermalink\n\nEven in cases where you don't want to preload data for a link, it can be beneficial to preload the code. The data-sveltekit-preload-code attribute works similarly to data-sveltekit-preload-data, except that it can take one of four values, in decreasing 'eagerness':\n\n\"eager\" means that links will be preloaded straight away\n\"viewport\" means that links will be preloaded once they enter the viewport\n\"hover\" - as above, except that only code is preloaded\n\"tap\" - as above, except that only code is preloaded\n\nNote that viewport and eager only apply to links that are present in the DOM immediately following navigation — if a link is added later (in an {#if ...} block, for example) it will not be preloaded until triggered by hover or tap. This is to avoid performance pitfalls resulting from aggressively observing the DOM for changes.\n\nSince preloading code is a prerequisite for preloading data, this attribute will only have an effect if it specifies a more eager value than any data-sveltekit-preload-data attribute that is present.\n\nAs with data-sveltekit-preload-data, this attribute will be ignored if the user has chosen reduced data usage.\n\ndata-sveltekit-reload\npermalink\n\nOccasionally, we need to tell SvelteKit not to handle a link, but allow the browser to handle it. Adding a data-sveltekit-reload attribute to a link...\n\n<a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/path\">Path</a>\n\n...will cause a full-page navigation when the link is clicked.\n\nLinks with a rel=\"external\" attribute will receive the same treatment. In addition, they will be ignored during prerendering.\n\ndata-sveltekit-replacestate\npermalink\n\nSometimes you don't want navigation to create a new entry in the browser's session history. Adding a data-sveltekit-replacestate attribute to a link...\n\n<a data-sveltekit-replacestate href=\"/path\">Path</a>\n\n...will replace the current history entry rather than creating a new one with pushState when the link is clicked.\n\ndata-sveltekit-keepfocus\npermalink\n\nSometimes you don't want focus to be reset after navigation. For example, maybe you have a search form that submits as the user is typing, and you want to keep focus on the text input. Adding a data-sveltekit-keepfocus attribute to it...\n\n<form data-sveltekit-keepfocus>\n\t<input type=\"text\" name=\"query\">\n</form>\n\n...will cause the currently focused element to retain focus after navigation. In general, avoid using this attribute on links, since the focused element would be the <a> tag (and not a previously focused element) and screen reader and other assistive technology users often expect focus to be moved after a navigation. You should also only use this attribute on elements that still exist after navigation. If the element no longer exists, the user's focus will be lost, making for a confusing experience for assistive technology users.\n\ndata-sveltekit-noscroll\npermalink\n\nWhen navigating to internal links, SvelteKit mirrors the browser's default navigation behaviour: it will change the scroll position to 0,0 so that the user is at the very top left of the page (unless the link includes a #hash, in which case it will scroll to the element with a matching ID).\n\nIn certain cases, you may wish to disable this behaviour. Adding a data-sveltekit-noscroll attribute to a link...\n\n<a href=\"path\" data-sveltekit-noscroll>Path</a>\n\n...will prevent scrolling after the link is clicked.\n\nDisabling options\npermalink\n\nTo disable any of these options inside an element where they have been enabled, use the \"false\" value:\n\n<div data-sveltekit-preload-data>\n\t<!-- these links will be preloaded -->\n\t<a href=\"/a\">a</a>\n\t<a href=\"/b\">b</a>\n\t<a href=\"/c\">c</a>\n\n\t<div data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"false\">\n\t\t<!-- these links will NOT be preloaded -->\n\t\t<a href=\"/d\">d</a>\n\t\t<a href=\"/e\">e</a>\n\t\t<a href=\"/f\">f</a>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\nTo apply an attribute to an element conditionally, do this (\"true\" and \"false\" are both accepted values):\n\n<div data-sveltekit-reload={shouldReload}>\nPREVIOUS\nErrors\nNEXT\nService workers"

    "html": "ADVANCED\n\nService workers\nService workers\nInside the service worker\nDuring development\nType safety\nOther solutions\n\nService workers act as proxy servers that handle network requests inside your app. This makes it possible to make your app work offline, but even if you don't need offline support (or can't realistically implement it because of the type of app you're building), it's often worth using service workers to speed up navigation by precaching your built JS and CSS.\n\nIn SvelteKit, if you have a src/service-worker.js file (or src/service-worker/index.js) it will be bundled and automatically registered. You can change the location of your service worker if you need to.\n\nYou can disable automatic registration if you need to register the service worker with your own logic or use another solution. The default registration looks something like this:\n\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n\taddEventListener('load', function () {\n\t\tnavigator.serviceWorker.register('./path/to/service-worker.js');\n\t});\n}\nInside the service worker\npermalink\n\nInside the service worker you have access to the $service-worker module, which provides you with the paths to all static assets, build files and prerendered pages. You're also provided with an app version string, which you can use for creating a unique cache name, and the deployment's base path. If your Vite config specifies define (used for global variable replacements), this will be applied to service workers as well as your server/client builds.\n\nThe following example caches the built app and any files in static eagerly, and caches all other requests as they happen. This would make each page work offline once visited.\n\n/// <reference types=\"@sveltejs/kit\" />\nimport { build, files, version } from '$service-worker';\n\n\n// Create a unique cache name for this deployment\nconst CACHE = `cache-${version}`;\n\n\nconst ASSETS = [\n\t...build, // the app itself\n\t...files  // everything in `static`\n];\n\n\nself.addEventListener('install', (event) => {\n\t// Create a new cache and add all files to it\n\tasync function addFilesToCache() {\n\t\tconst cache = await caches.open(CACHE);\n\t\tawait cache.addAll(ASSETS);\n\t}\n\n\n\tevent.waitUntil(addFilesToCache());\n});\n\n\nself.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {\n\t// Remove previous cached data from disk\n\tasync function deleteOldCaches() {\n\t\tfor (const key of await caches.keys()) {\n\t\t\tif (key !== CACHE) await caches.delete(key);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\n\tevent.waitUntil(deleteOldCaches());\n});\n\n\nself.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {\n\t// ignore POST requests etc\n\tif (event.request.method !== 'GET') return;\n\n\n\tasync function respond() {\n\t\tconst url = new URL(event.request.url);\n\t\tconst cache = await caches.open(CACHE);\n\n\n\t\t// `build`/`files` can always be served from the cache\n\t\tif (ASSETS.includes(url.pathname)) {\n\t\t\treturn cache.match(url.pathname);\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\t// for everything else, try the network first, but\n\t\t// fall back to the cache if we're offline\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tconst response = await fetch(event.request);\n\n\n\t\t\tif (response.status === 200) {\n\t\t\t\tcache.put(event.request, response.clone());\n\t\t\t}\n\n\n\t\t\treturn response;\n\t\t} catch {\n\t\t\treturn cache.match(event.request);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\n\tevent.respondWith(respond());\n});\n\nBe careful when caching! In some cases, stale data might be worse than data that's unavailable while offline. Since browsers will empty caches if they get too full, you should also be careful about caching large assets like video files.\n\nDuring development\npermalink\n\nThe service worker is bundled for production, but not during development. For that reason, only browsers that support modules in service workers will be able to use them at dev time. If you are manually registering your service worker, you will need to pass the { type: 'module' } option in development:\n\nimport { dev } from '$app/environment';\n\n\nnavigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {\n\ttype: dev ? 'module' : 'classic'\n});\n\nbuild and prerendered are empty arrays during development\n\nType safety\npermalink\n\nSetting up proper types for service workers requires some manual setup. Inside your service-worker.js, add the following to the top of your file:\n\n/// <reference types=\"@sveltejs/kit\" />\n/// <reference no-default-lib=\"true\"/>\n/// <reference lib=\"esnext\" />\n/// <reference lib=\"webworker\" />\n\n\nconst sw = /** @type {ServiceWorkerGlobalScope} */ (/** @type {unknown} */ (self));\n\nThis disables access to DOM typings like HTMLElement which are not available inside a service worker and instantiates the correct globals. The reassignment of self to sw allows you to type cast it in the process (there are a couple of ways to do this, but the easiest that requires no additional files). Use sw instead of self in the rest of the file. The reference to the SvelteKit types ensures that the $service-worker import has proper type definitions.\n\nOther solutions\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit's service worker implementation is deliberately low-level. If you need a more full-flegded but also more opinionated solution, we recommend looking at solutions like Vite PWA plugin, which uses Workbox. For more general information on service workers, we recommend the MDN web docs.\n\nPREVIOUS\nLink options\nNEXT\nServer-only modules"

    "html": "APPENDIX\n\nGlossary\nGlossary\nCSR\nHydration\nPrerendering\nRouting\nSPA\nSSG\nSSR\n\nThe core of SvelteKit provides a highly configurable rendering engine. This section describes some of the terms used when discussing rendering. A reference for setting these options is provided in the documentation above.\n\nCSR\npermalink\n\nClient-side rendering (CSR) is the generation of the page contents in the web browser using JavaScript.\n\nIn SvelteKit, client-side rendering will be used by default, but you can turn off JavaScript with the csr = false page option.\n\nHydration\npermalink\n\nSvelte components store some state and update the DOM when the state is updated. When fetching data during SSR, by default SvelteKit will store this data and transmit it to the client along with the server-rendered HTML. The components can then be initialized on the client with that data without having to call the same API endpoints again. Svelte will then check that the DOM is in the expected state and attach event listeners in a process called hydration. Once the components are fully hydrated, they can react to changes to their properties just like any newly created Svelte component.\n\nIn SvelteKit, pages will be hydrated by default, but you can turn off JavaScript with the csr = false page option.\n\nPrerendering\npermalink\n\nPrerendering means computing the contents of a page at build time and saving the HTML for display. This approach has the same benefits as traditional server-rendered pages, but avoids recomputing the page for each visitor and so scales nearly for free as the number of visitors increases. The tradeoff is that the build process is more expensive and prerendered content can only be updated by building and deploying a new version of the application.\n\nNot all pages can be prerendered. The basic rule is this: for content to be prerenderable, any two users hitting it directly must get the same content from the server, and the page must not contain actions. Note that you can still prerender content that is loaded based on the page's parameters as long as all users will be seeing the same prerendered content.\n\nPre-rendered pages are not limited to static content. You can build personalized pages if user-specific data is fetched and rendered client-side. This is subject to the caveat that you will experience the downsides of not doing SSR for that content as discussed above.\n\nIn SvelteKit, you can control prerendering with the prerender page option and prerender config in svelte.config.js.\n\nRouting\npermalink\n\nBy default, when you navigate to a new page (by clicking on a link or using the browser's forward or back buttons), SvelteKit will intercept the attempted navigation and handle it instead of allowing the browser to send a request to the server for the destination page. SvelteKit will then update the displayed contents on the client by rendering the component for the new page, which in turn can make calls to the necessary API endpoints. This process of updating the page on the client in response to attempted navigation is called client-side routing.\n\nIn SvelteKit, client-side routing will be used by default, but you can skip it with data-sveltekit-reload.\n\nSPA\npermalink\n\nA single-page app (SPA) is an application in which all requests to the server load a single HTML file which then does client-side rendering of the requested contents based on the requested URL. All navigation is handled on the client-side in a process called client-side routing with per-page contents being updated and common layout elements remaining largely unchanged. SPAs do not provide SSR, which has the shortcoming described above. However, some applications are not greatly impacted by these shortcomings such as a complex business application behind a login where SEO would not be important and it is known that users will be accessing the application from a consistent computing environment.\n\nIn SvelteKit, you can build an SPA with adapter-static.\n\nSSG\npermalink\n\nStatic Site Generation (SSG) is a term that refers to a site where every page is prerendered. SvelteKit was not built to do only static site generation like some tools and so may not scale as well to efficiently render a very large number of pages as tools built specifically for that purpose. However, in contrast to most purpose-built SSGs, SvelteKit does nicely allow for mixing and matching different rendering types on different pages. One benefit of fully prerendering a site is that you do not need to maintain or pay for servers to perform SSR. Once generated, the site can be served from CDNs, leading to great \"time to first byte\" performance. This delivery model is often referred to as JAMstack.\n\nIn SvelteKit, you can do static site generation by using adapter-static or by configuring every page to be prerendered using the prerender page option or prerender config in svelte.config.js.\n\nSSR\npermalink\n\nServer-side rendering (SSR) is the generation of the page contents on the server. SSR is generally preferred for SEO. While some search engines can index content that is dynamically generated on the client-side it may take longer even in these cases. It also tends to improve perceived performance and makes your app accessible to users if JavaScript fails or is disabled (which happens more often than you probably think).\n\nIn SvelteKit, pages are server-side rendered by default. You can disable SSR with the ssr page option.\n\nPREVIOUS\nAdditional resources\nNEXT"

Out of the box, SvelteKit supports many features including:\n\nDynamic page content with load functions and API routes.\nSEO-friendly dynamic content with server-side rendering (SSR).\nUser-friendly progressively-enhanced interactive pages with SSR and Form Actions.\nStatic pages with prerendering.\n\nSvelteKit can also be deployed to a wide spectrum of hosted architectures via adapters. In cases where SSR is used (or server-side logic is added without prerendering), those functions will be adapted to the target backend. Some examples include:\n\nSelf-hosted dynamic web applications with a Node.js backend.\nServerless web applications with backend loaders and APIs deployed as remote functions. See zero-config deployments for popular deployment options.\nStatic pre-rendered sites such as a blog or multi-page site hosted on a CDN or static host. Statically-generated sites are shipped without a backend.\nSingle-page Applications (SPAs) with client-side routing and rendering for API-driven dynamic content. SPAs are shipped without a backend and are not server-rendered. This option is commonly chosen when bundling SvelteKit with an app written in PHP, .Net, Java, C, Golang, Rust, etc.\nA mix of the above; some routes can be static, and some routes can use backend functions to fetch dynamic information. This can be configured with page options that includes the option to opt out of SSR.\n\nIn order to support SSR, a JS backend — such as Node.js or Deno-based server, serverless function, or edge function — is required.\n\nIt is also possible to write custom adapters or leverage community adapters to deploy SvelteKit to more platforms such as specialized server environments, browser extensions, or native applications. See integrations for more examples and integrations.\n\nHow do I use HMR with SvelteKit?\npermalink\n\nSvelteKit has HMR enabled by default powered by svelte-hmr. If you saw Rich's presentation at the 2020 Svelte Summit, you may have seen a more powerful-looking version of HMR presented. This demo had svelte-hmr's preserveLocalState flag on. This flag is now off by default because it may lead to unexpected behaviour and edge cases. But don't worry, you are still getting HMR with SvelteKit! If you'd like to preserve local state you can use the @hmr:keep or @hmr:keep-all directives as documented on the svelte-hmr page.\n\nHow do I include details from package.json in my application?\npermalink\n\nYou cannot directly require JSON files, since SvelteKit expects svelte.config.js to be an ES module. If you'd like to include your application's version number or other information from package.json in your application, you can load JSON like so:\n\nsvelte.config.js\nimport { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';\n\n\nconst path = fileURLToPath(new URL('package.json', import.meta.url));\nconst pkg = JSON.parse(readFileSync(path, 'utf8'));\nHow do I fix the error I'm getting trying to include a package?\npermalink\n\nMost issues related to including a library are due to incorrect packaging. You can check if a library's packaging is compatible with Node.js by entering it into the publint website.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when checking if a library is packaged correctly:\n\nexports takes precedence over the other entry point fields such as main and module. Adding an exports field may not be backwards-compatible as it prevents deep imports.\nESM files should end with .mjs unless \"type\": \"module\" is set in which any case CommonJS files should end with .cjs.\nmain should be defined if exports is not. It should be either a CommonJS or ESM file and adhere to the previous bullet. If a module field is defined, it should refer to an ESM file.\nSvelte components should be distributed as uncompiled .svelte files with any JS in the package written as ESM only. Custom script and style languages, like TypeScript and SCSS, should be preprocessed as vanilla JS and CSS respectively. We recommend using svelte-package for packaging Svelte libraries, which will do this for you.\n\nLibraries work best in the browser with Vite when they distribute an ESM version, especially if they are dependencies of a Svelte component library. You may wish to suggest to library authors that they provide an ESM version. However, CommonJS (CJS) dependencies should work as well since, by default, vite-plugin-svelte will ask Vite to pre-bundle them using esbuild to convert them to ESM.\n\nIf you are still encountering issues we recommend searching both the Vite issue tracker and the issue tracker of the library in question. Sometimes issues can be worked around by fiddling with the optimizeDeps or ssr config values though we recommend this as only a short-term workaround in favor of fixing the library in question.\n\nHow do I use the view transitions API with SvelteKit?\npermalink\n\nWhile SvelteKit does not have any specific integration with view transitions, you can call document.startViewTransition in onNavigate to trigger a view transition on every navigation.\n\nimport { onNavigate } from '$app/navigation';\n\n\nonNavigate((navigation) => {\n\tif (!document.startViewTransition) return;\n\n\n\treturn new Promise((resolve) => {\n\t\tdocument.startViewTransition(async () => {\n\t\t\tresolve();\n\t\t\tawait navigation.complete;\n\t\t});\n\t});\n});\n\nFor more, see \"Unlocking view transitions\" on the Svelte blog.\n\nHow do I use X with SvelteKit?\npermalink\n\nMake sure you've read the documentation section on integrations. If you're still having trouble, solutions to common issues are listed below.\n\nHow do I setup a database?\npermalink\n\nPut the code to query your database in a server route - don't query the database in .svelte files. You can create a db.js or similar that sets up a connection immediately and makes the client accessible throughout the app as a singleton. You can execute any one-time setup code in hooks.js and import your database helpers into any endpoint that needs them.\n\nHow do I use a client-side only library that depends on document or window?\npermalink\n\nIf you need access to the document or window variables or otherwise need code to run only on the client-side you can wrap it in a browser check:\n\nimport { browser } from '$app/environment';\n\n\nif (browser) {\n\t// client-only code here\n}\n\nYou can also run code in onMount if you'd like to run it after the component has been first rendered to the DOM:\n\nimport { onMount } from 'svelte';\n\n\nonMount(async () => {\n\tconst { method } = await import('some-browser-only-library');\n\tmethod('hello world');\n});\n\nIf the library you'd like to use is side-effect free you can also statically import it and it will be tree-shaken out in the server-side build where onMount will be automatically replaced with a no-op:\n\nimport { onMount } from 'svelte';\nimport { method } from 'some-browser-only-library';\n\n\nonMount(() => {\n\tmethod('hello world');\n});\n\nFinally, you may also consider using an {#await} block:\n\nindex.svelte\n<script>\n\timport { browser } from '$app/environment';\n\n\tconst ComponentConstructor = browser ?\n\t\timport('some-browser-only-library').then((module) => module.Component) :\n\t\tnew Promise(() => {});\n</script>\n\n{#await ComponentConstructor}\n\t<p>Loading...</p>\n{:then component}\n\t<svelte:component this={component} />\n{:catch error}\n\t<p>Something went wrong: {error.message}</p>\n{/await}\nHow do I use a different backend API server?\npermalink\n\nYou can use event.fetch to request data from an external API server, but be aware that you would need to deal with CORS, which will result in complications such as generally requiring requests to be preflighted resulting in higher latency. Requests to a separate subdomain may also increase latency due to an additional DNS lookup, TLS setup, etc. If you wish to use this method, you may find handleFetch helpful.\n\nAnother approach is to set up a proxy to bypass CORS headaches. In production, you would rewrite a path like /api to the API server; for local development, use Vite's server.proxy option.\n\nHow to setup rewrites in production will depend on your deployment platform. If rewrites aren't an option, you could alternatively add an API route:\n\nsrc/routes/api/[...path]/+server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport function GET({ params, url }) {\n\treturn fetch(`https://my-api-server.com/${params.path + url.search}`);\n}\n\n(Note that you may also need to proxy POST/PATCH etc requests, and forward request.headers, depending on your needs.)\n\nHow do I use middleware?\npermalink\n\nadapter-node builds a middleware that you can use with your own server for production mode. In dev, you can add middleware to Vite by using a Vite plugin. For example:\n\nimport { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\n\n/** @type {import('vite').Plugin} */\nconst myPlugin = {\n\tname: 'log-request-middleware',\n\tconfigureServer(server) {\n\t\tserver.middlewares.use((req, res, next) => {\n\t\t\tconsole.log(`Got request ${req.url}`);\n\t\t\tnext();\n\t\t});\n\t}\n};\n\n\n/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */\nconst config = {\n\tplugins: [myPlugin, sveltekit()]\n};\n\n\nexport default config;\n\nSee Vite's configureServer docs for more details including how to control ordering.\n\nDoes it work with Yarn 2?\npermalink\n\nSort of. The Plug'n'Play feature, aka 'pnp', is broken (it deviates from the Node module resolution algorithm, and doesn't yet work with native JavaScript modules which SvelteKit — along with an increasing number of packages — uses). You can use nodeLinker: 'node-modules' in your .yarnrc.yml file to disable pnp, but it's probably easier to just use npm or pnpm, which is similarly fast and efficient but without the compatibility headaches.\n\nHow do I use with Yarn 3?\npermalink\n\nCurrently ESM Support within the latest Yarn (version 3) is considered experimental.\n\nThe below seems to work although your results may vary.\n\nFirst create a new application:\n\nyarn create svelte myapp\ncd myapp\n\nAnd enable Yarn Berry:\n\nyarn set version berry\nyarn install\nYarn 3 global cache\npermalink\n\nOne of the more interesting features of Yarn Berry is the ability to have a single global cache for packages, instead of having multiple copies for each project on the disk. However, setting enableGlobalCache to true causes building to fail, so it is recommended to add the following to the .yarnrc.yml file:\n\nnodeLinker: node-modules\n\nThis will cause packages to be downloaded into a local node_modules directory but avoids the above problem and is your best bet for using version 3 of Yarn at this point in time.\n\nPREVIOUS\nTypes\nNEXT\nIntegrations"

If you're coming from React, SvelteKit is similar to Next. If you're coming from Vue, SvelteKit is similar to Nuxt.\n\nTo learn more about the kinds of applications you can build with SvelteKit, see the FAQ.\n\nWhat is Svelte?\npermalink\n\nIn short, Svelte is a way of writing user interface components — like a navigation bar, comment section, or contact form — that users see and interact with in their browsers. The Svelte compiler converts your components to JavaScript that can be run to render the HTML for the page and to CSS that styles the page. You don't need to know Svelte to understand the rest of this guide, but it will help. If you'd like to learn more, check out the Svelte tutorial.\n\nSvelteKit vs Svelte\npermalink\n\nSvelte renders UI components. You can compose these components and render an entire page with just Svelte, but you need more than just Svelte to write an entire app.\n\nSvelteKit helps you build web apps while following modern best practices and providing solutions to common development challenges. It offers everything from basic functionalities — like a router that updates your UI when a link is clicked — to more advanced capabilities. Its extensive list of features includes build optimizations to load only the minimal required code; offline support; preloading pages before user navigation; configurable rendering to handle different parts of your app on the server via SSR, in the browser through client-side rendering, or at build-time with prerendering; and much more. Building an app with all the modern best practices is fiendishly complicated, but SvelteKit does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.\n\nIt reflects changes to your code in the browser instantly to provide a lightning-fast and feature-rich development experience by leveraging Vite with a Svelte plugin to do Hot Module Replacement (HMR).\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\nCreating a project"
